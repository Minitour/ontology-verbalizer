","The brain is a sub-concept of the organ and the ectoderm-derived structure. It is described as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrates and most invertebrates. However, primitive animals like starfish and jellyfish have a decentralized nervous system without a brain, and sponges completely lack a nervous system. It is situated in the animal's head, securing protection from the skull and situated near the primary sensory apparatus like vision, hearing, smell, taste, and balance. 

Externally, the brain can be defined in several ways. The Terminologia Anatomica Online describes it as a cavitated compound organ composed of gray and white matter, surrounding the cerebral ventricular system. The Australian Animals Online views it as a part of the central nervous system within the cranium, comprised of nerve cell bodies and nerve fibers. The Columbia University Medical Business Office (CUMBO) defines it as the part of the central nervous system contained in the cranium. It comprises the forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, and metencephalon, derived from the anterior part of the embryonic neural tube, also known as the encephalon. Notably, their definition excludes the retina.

The anatomy of the brain is related to the five uniquely derived characters or synapomorphies of the chordate at some point in its development. One of these features is a single, tubular nerve cord dorsal to the notochord, which will differentiate into the brain and spinal cord, forming the central nervous system. The brain has several related synonyms, including encephalon, suprasegmental levels of the nervous system, suprasegmental structures, synganglion, and 'the brain'."

","The cerebral cortex is a sub-concept of both, central nervous system cell part cluster and central nervous system gray matter layer. It is defined as the thin layer of gray matter on the surface of the cerebral hemisphere that develops from the telencephalon. This includes the neocortex (6 layered cortex or isocortex), the hippocampal formation, and the olfactory cortex. The cortex plays a key role in memory, attention, perceptual awareness, thought, language, and consciousness. It is the structure within the brain that forms the outermost layer of the cerebrum, which is the cause of its gray color, granting it the name 'gray matter'. Gray matter comprises neurons and their unmyelinated fibers, while the white matter, located beneath the gray matter of the cortex, is majorly formed by myelinated axons interconnecting different regions of the central nervous system. The cortex in human brains is 2-4 mm (0.08-0.16 inches) thick, with more than two-thirds of the cortical surface buried in the grooves, called 'sulci'. 

The cortex can also be differentiated by its horizontal layers - the newer part of the cerebral cortex or the neocortex (isocortex) has six layers, while the older part - the hippocampus (archicortex), consists of three cellular layers at most. Variations in thickness or cell type among other parameters distinguish between the different neocortical architectonic fields. The geometry of some of these fields seems connected to the anatomy of the cortical folds.

The cortex is also acknowledged to have first appeared in reptiles. Though some opine that primitive dipnoans might also host a pallium or cortex, the extensive laminated layer separated by underlying white matter is recognized only in reptiles and mammals.
It has been found that hagfishes have independently evolved an intricately laminated cerebral cortex, comparable to that of mammals. 

The cortex goes by several synonymous terms, such as cortex of the cerebral hemisphere, brain cortex, cortex cerebralis, cortex cerebri, cortical plate (CTXpl), cortical plate (areas), and pallium of the brain.

","The cerebrospinal fluid, also known as CSF or cerebral spinal fluid, is a sub-concept of transudate and multicellular anatomical structure. It is defined as a clear, colorless bodily fluid, found in the subarachnoid space and the ventricular system surrounding and within the brain and spinal cord. This definition is reiterated by the external definition, emphasizing that the CSF is a portion of organism substance occupying the subarachnoid space and ventricular system.

Furthermore, there are several notes regarding CSF's development and specifics in different organisms. The homology notes highlight that in early stages of vertebrate Central Nervous System (CNS) development, the architecture of the brain primordium reveals the presence of brain vesicle cavities, filled by Embryonic Cerebro-Spinal Fluid (E-CSF). There are noted similarities between rat and chick E-CSF proteomes. However, the rat proteome is more complex in certain protein groups and contains soluble enzymes, similar to adult human CSF, unlike the chick E-CSF.

This points to phylogenetic brain differences amongst these vertebrates. There are also notes regarding the external ontology of CSF, pointing out corrections in the modeling, variations in different anatomical definitions, and the circuit of CSF within the subarachnoid space and brain ventricles. Additionally, it is noted that CSF moves in a pulsatile manner throughout the CSF system with nearly zero net flow and is reabsorbed into the venous sinus blood via arachnoid granulations.

Furthermore, the cerebrospinal fluid has other synonyms, including 'liquor cerebrospinalis' and 'spinal fluid'."

According to an external definition, the Amygdala is a dorso-medial, almond-shaped gray mass in the temporal lobe; it is a subdivision of the basal ganglion of the telencephalon (FMA:61841). 

The Amygdala shares a homologous relation with the Archistriatum, which consists of loosely segregated nuclei called the amygdaloid complex in fishes. In mammals, the Amygdala tends to be located ventrally to other basal nuclei. 

The Amygdala is synonymous with Amygdaloid Body, Amygdaloid Complex, Amygdaloid Nuclear Complex, Amygdaloid Nuclear Groups, and the Archistriatum. It is also known by related terms such as Amygdaloid Area, Amygdaloid Nuclear Group, Amygdaloid Nucleus, Corpus Amygdalae, Corpus Amygdaloideum, and Nucleus Amygdalae, and is sometimes depicted by a specific image link online. It is important to note, however, that the MA and the FMA differ on the relationship of the Amygdala to the Basal Ganglion, creating some complexity in its classification. One last notable feature of the Amygdala is that it has a relational adjective in the form of ""Amygdalar""."

","The cerebellum is a sub-concept of the regional part of the brain and a structure with a developmental contribution from the neural crest. Defined as a part of the metencephalon, it lies in the posterior cranial fossa behind the brainstem and is responsible for the co-ordination of movement, control of muscle tone, and balance. In humans, it consists of two lateral lobes and a median lobe. It's noteworthy that the cerebellum is not present in certain taxons and dubious for others, but is evident in some specific ones. 

The cerebellum has an external definition as the dorsal part of the hindbrain that coordinates muscle movement, posture, and balance and is derived from the dorsal metencephalon, becoming distinctive late in the segmentation period. Intriguingly, albeit the lamprey possesses a region comparable to the cerebellum and displays expression of LjFgf8/17 at the MHB (midbrain hindbrain boundary), it does not have Purkinje cells and cerebellar nuclei, or components of the rhombic lip-derived cerebellar and pre-cerebellar systems. 

It's speculated that the cerebellum is an evolutionary innovation in gnathostomes, based on exaptation of MHB, rhombic lip, and some regulatory gene expression already present in the vertebrate common ancestor. The cerebellum has the relational adjective ""cerebellar"" and is often referred to synonymously as the infratentorial region, epencephalon-1, corpus cerebelli, and parencephalon. It's important to mention the absence of the cerebellum in hagfishes and lampreys is considered an exception. The cerebellum is generally agreed to be a part of the hindbrain, and it is sometimes specifically a part of the metencephalon. It's depicted by various sources including a URL provided."
