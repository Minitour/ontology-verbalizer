The pectoral girdle region is also known by several synonyms. It has exact synonyms, including ""cingulum membri superioris"" and ""girdle - pectoral."" Additionally, it has narrow synonyms such as ""cingulum membri superioris,"" ""shoulder girdle,"" and ""upper limb girdle."" Moreover, it has related synonyms like ""pectoral girdle"" and ""pectoral region,"" further illustrating the variety of terms used to describe or relate to this specific region of an organism.",14,True

The microscopic structure of a gill is such that it presents a very large surface area to the external environment. Gills usually consist of thin filaments of tissue, branches, or slender tufted processes which have a highly folded surface to increase surface area. A high surface area is crucial to the gas exchange of aquatic organisms as water contains only 1/20 parts dissolved Oxygen compared to air. With the exception of some aquatic insects, the filaments and lamellae (folds) contain blood or coelomic fluid, from which gases are exchanged through the thin walls. Oxygen is carried by the blood to other parts of the body. Carbon dioxide passes from the blood through the thin gill tissue into the water.

","Gills are a type of organ that forms at least part of the respiratory system in many aquatic organisms. They serve as a respiration organ with the primary function of extracting oxygen from water and excreting carbon dioxide. The anatomical and microscopic structure of a gill is characterized by a very large surface area relative to its external environment, which is essential for effective gas exchange. This is achieved through gills typically consisting of thin filaments of tissue, branches, or slender tufted processes that possess a highly folded surface to maximize the surface area. The significance of a high surface area is underscored by the fact that water contains only 1/20 parts dissolved oxygen compared to air. Gills or gill-like organs, which may be located in different parts of the body, are observed across a diverse range of aquatic animals, including mollusks, crustaceans, insects, fish, and amphibians. These structures usually contain blood or coelomic fluid within their filaments and lamellae (folds), facilitating the exchange of gases through their thin walls. Oxygen absorbed from the water is transported by the blood to other parts of the body, while carbon dioxide is expelled from the blood into the water through the gill tissue.",3,True
