Its formation begins when a glacier moves over an area containing alternate bands of hard and soft bedrock.

On either side of the rock basin, the more resistant rock is eroded less and these outcrops of harder rock are known as rock bars, which act as dams between which rainwater may accumulate after the retreat of the ice age, filling up the rock basin and creating a ribbon lake. A ribbon lake may also form behind a terminal or recessional moraine, both of which also act as dams, enabling water to accumulate behind them. A ribbon lake may also occur if a tributary glacier joins a main glacier. The increase in power can create a trough, which is filled with water from a river/meltwater to create a ribbon lake.""^^xsd:string .

","A ribbon lake is a specific type of lake characterized by its long, narrow, and finger-shaped appearance, commonly located in a glacial trough. The process of its formation starts when a glacier traverses over an area composed of alternating bands of hard and soft bedrock. The glacier carries sharp-edged boulders at its base, which preferentially erode the softer rock through a process called abrasion, leading to the creation of a depression known as a rock basin. Adjacent to the rock basin, the less eroded, more resistant rock forms outcrops called rock bars, serving as natural barriers. These rock bars function as dams, allowing rainwater to collect between them after the glacier recedes, subsequently filling the rock basin and resulting in the formation of a ribbon lake. Additionally, ribbon lakes can form behind natural barriers such as terminal or recessional moraines, which similarly act as dams that facilitate the accumulation of water. Another scenario for the formation of a ribbon lake occurs when a tributary glacier merges with a main glacier, increasing the erosional power and creating a trough. This trough can then be filled with river water or meltwater, further contributing to the creation of a ribbon lake.",2,True
