","The ice bearing permafrost thawing process is a multifaceted phenomenon, classified under several categories due to its complex nature. Primarily, it is recognized as a type of permafrost thawing process. Additionally, it plays a significant role in the warming of both liquids and solids, highlighting its impact on different states of matter. This process is also categorized under hydrological processes, emphasizing its involvement in water-related changes in the environment. More specifically, it is part of processes that inherently include hydrological melting processes, indicating its critical contribution to the transformation of ice to water.

Furthermore, the ice bearing permafrost thawing process is intricately linked to water ice and permafrost, as it involves the interaction with substances that are both part of permafrost and contain water ice. One of the key outcomes of this process is the production of meltwater, showcasing its role in the conversion of solid ice within permafrost into liquid water. Moreover, this process is causally upstream of methane gas emission processes, indicating its indirect contribution to the release of methane into the atmosphere, a potent greenhouse gas.

The ice bearing permafrost thawing process is comprehensively defined as a permafrost thawing process during which water-based ice or snow present in permafrost is converted into meltwater.
