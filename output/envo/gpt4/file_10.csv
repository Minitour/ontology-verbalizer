The Codex Classification includes food commodities and animal feedstuffs for which Codex maximum residue limits will not necessarily be established. The Classification is intended to be as complete a listing of food commodities in trade as possible, classified into groups on the basis of the commodity's similar potential for pesticide residues.

The Classification may also be appropriate for other purposes such as setting maximum levels for other types of residues or for other contaminants in food. The Codex Classification should be consulted in order to obtain a precise description of the food or animal feed commodities and, especially, in cases where Codex maximum residue limits have been set for groups of food and groups of animal feedstuffs.

Designed to be a comprehensive listing, the Classification organizes food commodities into groups based on their similar potential for pesticide residues.

It is crucial for obtaining precise descriptions of food or animal feed commodities, particularly when Codex maximum residue limits are applicable to specific groups.
