","A chthonian planet, also known exactly as a cthonian planet, is a type of planet that is the same as something which is both a planet and derives from a giant gas planet, and also formed as a result of an intersection between processes including photoevaporation and hydrodynamic escape, and at least causally downstream of or within a stellar wind. Specifically, a chthonian planet is defined as a planet formed from the remnants of a gas giant whose hydrogen and helium atmosphere, along with its outer layers, are stripped away by stellar wind through mechanisms such as photoevaporation and hydrodynamic escape. This makes a chthonian planet a subtype of planets that originate from giant gas planets and are shaped by these specific cosmic phenomena.",6,True

It is identified as a specific type of material transport process that involves several key characteristics. These characteristics include being a part of electromagnetic radiation, involving gaseous environmental material as a participant, and having both an input and an output that consists of gaseous environmental material. The input of atmospheric escape is an intersection of gaseous environmental material and a part of some planetary atmosphere, while its output is an intersection of gaseous environmental material that is located in outer space.

The detailed definition provided for the ice decumulation zone further clarifies its nature: it is a material decumulation zone where the rates of ice formation are outpaced by the rates of ice decumulation, resulting in a net decrease in ice mass. This highlights the dynamic processes at play, emphasizing the imbalance between ice formation and loss.

","The Cumulonimbus cloud is a type of water-based cloud characterized by a number of distinctive features. Firstly, it spans across various atmospheric levels, including the low, middle, and high atmospheric levels. This cloud type is notable for its increased size and increased mass density. The structure of a Cumulonimbus cloud includes a top part that intersects with flat qualities, indicating that the cloud's upper portion is often flattened.

Compositionally, Cumulonimbus clouds are primarily made of an aggregate of objects that include both water droplets and water ice crystals. This indicates a complex structure that combines liquid and frozen forms of water, contributing to its dense and towering appearance.

A detailed definition of a Cumulonimbus cloud outlines it as a cloud that forms dense, mountain-like shapes or tower-like structures with a flattened upper part, which may spread out resembling an anvil or plume. In addition to being composed of water droplets, particularly in its lower parts, the cloud also contains ice crystals, especially in its upper portion. Despite originating in the low level of the atmosphere, a Cumulonimbus cloud has the capacity to extend into the middle and high atmospheric levels.

Moreover, the Cumulonimbus cloud is also known by exact synonyms ""Cumulonibus-Wolke"" and ""Gewitterwolke,"" reflecting its association with thunderstorm phenomena and its recognition in different languages.",9,True
