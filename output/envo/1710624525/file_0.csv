The presence of these two components allows NAD+ to be involved in various metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis, and the citric acid cycle (also known as Krebs cycle).
NAD+ also functions as a redox indicator by accepting electrons during oxidation and transferring them to other molecules. This property makes it a valuable tool in biochemistry for detecting and quantifying various cellular processes. For example, changes in NAD+ levels can indicate the presence of an enzyme that is involved in a particular metabolic pathway or the activity level of certain proteins.

Fatty acid anions are typically derived from saturated or unsaturated fatty acids through a process called esterification, where the hydroxyl (OH) groups of the fatty acid are replaced with an alcohol to form an ester. This results in the formation of a lipid molecule that is soluble in both water and oil. Fatty acid anions can be further modified by the addition of functional groups, such as phosphate or sulfate, which can alter their properties and functions within biological systems.

These elements are nonmetals and have similar physical and chemical properties, such as being highly reactive and having a strong affinity for other elements.

In chemistry, molecular entities refer to specific types of atoms or groups of atoms that form the basic building blocks of larger compounds. The term ""p-block"" refers to a certain group of elements in the periodic table, which are located below carbon (C) and above the halogens (F, Cl, Br, I). These elements have similar chemical properties and often participate in similar types of reactions.
