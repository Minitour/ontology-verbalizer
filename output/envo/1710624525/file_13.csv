The skin epithelium also plays a role in protecting the body from environmental factors such as UV rays, heat, cold, and chemicals. It acts as a barrier that prevents harmful substances from entering the body while allowing nutrients and oxygen to pass through. In addition, the skin epithelium helps regulate the body's temperature by trapping a layer of insulating fat underneath it.

This system is responsible for supplying oxygen and nutrients to the neurons in the brain and maintaining proper circulation. The blood-brain barrier also plays a crucial role in protecting the brain from harmful substances, such as toxins or pathogens.
On the other hand, the retina is a specialized layer of tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and converts it into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve. The vasculature of the retina consists of a complex network of blood vessels called the choroid, which provides oxygen and nutrients to the retinal neurons. However, the central nervous system and the retina have different types of blood vessels, with distinct functions and structures.

    :has_definition ""An anatomical system that eliminates waste products that arise as a result of metabolic activity."" .

","The excretory system is a biological system that serves the purpose of eliminating waste products from an organism. It includes all of the organs, tubes, and other structures involved in the removal of metabolic waste products from the body. Some examples of organs within the excretory system include the kidneys, liver, and lungs. The process of elimination typically occurs through urine or fecal matter, depending on the type of organism and its location within the body.
Excretion is an essential process for maintaining proper bodily function and overall health. By removing waste products from the body, the excretory system helps to prevent the buildup of harmful substances, which can lead to various health problems if left unchecked. Additionally, the excretory system also plays a role in regulating fluid balance within the body, as it works in conjunction with other systems such as the cardiovascular and renal systems.",2,True
