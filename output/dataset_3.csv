","The ecosystem fragmentation process can be understood as the intersection of the ecosystem process, which involves input from varying aspects of the ecosystem and results in the formation of fragments within the same ecosystem. This fragmentation process is a subclass of several other processes. Firstly, it falls under the ecosystem process itself. Additionally, it is considered a part of the biological process. This process also co-exists as a participating factor in producing inputs for the ecosystem and in creating fragments of the ecosystem. Moreover, the ecosystem fragmentation process is causally upstream of or within the domain of factors contributing to ecosystem decay. The definition that encapsulates the ecosystem fragmentation process is that it's a process during which one or more parts of an ecosystem become causally isolated, causing a severe curtailment or complete halt in the direct flow or exchange of materials, resources, and energy between a given fragment and the remainder of the original system."

","The wetland ecosystem is a sub-class of ecosystem and it is partially composed of an intersection of planetary landmass and soil with predominance of wet quality. A wetland ecosystem is a terrestrial ecosystem usually inundated or saturated by surface or ground water frequented enough to support a specific type of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. This exact definition is also referred to as 'wetland' or 'WETLAND'. Specific types of wetland ecosystems are also referred to as EstuarineWetland, LacustrineWetland, MarineWetland, PalustrineWetland, and TerrestialWetland. Additionally, it carries several other narrow synonyms that often describe different types of wetland ecosystems, such as RiparianWetland, back marsh, backswamp, backwater, barrier flat, blanket bog, bog, and cienaga among many others. Some related synonyms for the wetland ecosystem include moor, morass, and muskeg."
