","Combined Oxidative Phosphorylation Deficiency 2 (COXPD2) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to produce energy. It is an autosomal recessive disease, which means that it is inherited from both parents and can cause severe health problems if both copies of the gene are affected.

COXPD2 occurs due to mutations in the MRPS16 gene on chromosome 10q22.2. These mutations disrupt the function of mitochondria, which are small structures within cells that produce energy. As a result, the body is unable to produce enough energy, leading to a range of symptoms and health problems.

Some common signs and symptoms of COXPD2 include developmental delays, intellectual disability, seizures, and lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis occurs when there is an excessive buildup of lactic acid in the bloodstream, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.

There is currently no cure for COXPD2, but treatment options are available to help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. These may include medications, nutritional therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, and other specialized interventions. It is important for individuals with COXPD2 to work closely with their healthcare team to develop an individualized treatment plan that meets their specific needs.",6,True

","combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency 32 is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to produce energy. It is caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA, which leads to a deficiency in the production of ATP. This can cause a range of symptoms, including developmental delays, muscle weakness, and poor growth. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning that it requires the inheritance of two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) for its expression. Treatment typically focuses on managing symptoms and providing support to affected individuals.",5,True

","Li Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is a rare genetic disorder that affects multiple organs and tissues in the body. It is characterized by the presence of two or more malignant tumors, especially in children, and a strong family history of cancer. LFS is caused by mutations in one of several tumor suppressor genes, including TP53, CHEK2, and ATM.
LFS can affect different parts of the body, such as the bones, brain, adrenal glands, and soft tissues. Some common types of cancer that are more likely to occur in people with LFS include breast, ovarian, thyroid, lung, and adrenal gland tumors.
Early detection and treatment of LFS are important to reduce the risk of developing multiple tumors and improve overall health outcomes. Genetic counseling and testing can help identify individuals who may be at risk for LFS. Treatment options depend on the specific type of cancer and its location, but may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of these treatments.
In conclusion, Li Fraumeni Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that increases the risk of developing multiple types of cancer. Early detection and treatment are crucial for improving health outcomes in those affected by this condition.",3,True

","Linear nevus sebaceous syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the skin, eyes, and skeletal system. It is characterized by the presence of multiple sebaceous gland tumors on the face and other parts of the body. The condition can also be associated with abnormalities in the central nervous system, eye defects, and skeletal deformities.

The syndrome is caused by somatic mosaic mutations in the NRAS, HRAS, or KRAS genes on chromosomes 1p13.2, 11p15.5, or 12p12.1, respectively. It has exact synonyms such as JNP, Jadassohn nevus phakomatosis, SFM syndrome, Schimmelpenning Feuerstein Mims syndrome, Schimmelpenning syndrome, Solomon syndrome, nevus sebaceus of Jadassohn, and nevus sebaceus syndrome. It can also be referred to as organoid nevus phakomatosis or organoid nevus syndrome.

It's important to note that Linear nevus sebaceous syndrome is a rare genetic disorder and its diagnosis should only be made by experts in genetic and medical fields. If you suspect that you or someone you know may have this condition, it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional for proper evaluation and management.",12,True

Aplasia refers to underdevelopment or failure of development of the affected glands. In this case, the lacrimal and salivary glands may be missing or undersized. This can lead to problems such as dry eyes, difficulty swallowing, and a decreased ability to produce saliva. Some individuals with ALSG may also experience other symptoms, including cleft lip and palate, dental issues, hearing loss, and intellectual disability.
Unfortunately, there is no cure for Aplasia of the lacrimal and salivary glands at this time. However, treatments are available to help manage its symptoms. For example, individuals with dry eyes can use eye drops or other lubricating products to help keep their eyes moist. Additionally, a diet rich in saliva-producing foods, such as carrots and apples, can also be helpful. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to correct anatomical abnormalities or remove excess tissue from the affected glands.",6,True

","familial isolated trichomegaly is an eyelid disease characterized by the prolonged anagen phase of the eyelash hairs resulting in extremely long eyelashes. This condition has a material basis in homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the FGF5 gene on chromosome 4q21.21. The term ""familial"" indicates that this disease is inherited and can be passed down through generations of a family, while the term ""isolated"" implies that it is not part of a larger syndrome or class of diseases.
Treatment for familial isolated trichomegaly may involve removing excess eyelashes with tweezers or using electrolysis to destroy the hair follicle. Other options include using creams or lotions containing tretinoin, alpha hydroxy acid, or ketoconazole to help manage irritation and reduce inflammation. In severe cases, a surgical procedure called blepharoplasty may be necessary to remove excess skin, fat, and eyelashes from the upper and lower lids.
It's important for individuals with this condition to follow good hygiene practices to prevent infections and irritation caused by their long eyelashes. They should also avoid using harsh chemicals or hot water when washing their face, as these can cause irritation and damage the eyelashes.
Familial isolated trichomegaly is a relatively rare condition, but with proper care and management, individuals with this condition can lead normal lives.",6,True

","dihydropyrimidinase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that affects the metabolism of pyrimidine, an important component of DNA. It occurs due to a lack or malfunctioning of the enzyme dihydropyrimidinase, which is responsible for breaking down uracil and thymine in the body. This leads to the accumulation of uracil and thymine in the body, causing symptoms such as high levels of 5-carboxy-urea (5,6-dihydrouracil) and 5,6-dihydrothymine (5,6-dihydrothymine) in urine.
Dihydropyrimidinase deficiency can be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, meaning that a person needs to inherit two copies of the faulty gene (one from each parent) to develop the condition. It is also possible for dihydropyrimidinase deficiency to be inherited in a compound heterozygous manner, where both parents pass on one working and one non-working copy of the gene.
Symptoms of dihydropyrimidinase deficiency can vary widely depending on the severity of the enzyme deficiency, but may include gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, nausea and vomiting, as well as skin rashes, hair loss, and joint pain. In severe cases, dihydropyrimidinase deficiency can lead to life-threatening complications such as seizures, coma, and even death if not treated promptly with appropriate medical interventions.
Diagnosis of dihydropyrimidinase deficiency typically involves a combination of laboratory tests, including urine analysis for high levels of 5,6-dihydrouracil and 5,6-dihydrothymine, as well as genetic testing to confirm the presence of mutations in the DPYS gene.
Treatment options for dihydropyrimidinase deficiency depend on the severity of the condition and can include dietary changes, medication, and other supportive measures to manage symptoms. In some cases, enzyme replacement therapy may be recommended for individuals with severe or life-threatening forms of the disorder.",8,True

In some cases, enzyme replacement therapy may also be recommended to supplement the missing sucrase-isomaltase enzymes.

","glutamate formiminotransferase deficiency is a type of vitamin metabolic disorder. It is caused by a lack of the enzyme glutamate formiminotransferase, which is involved in the metabolism of glutamate. This can lead to elevated levels of formiminoglutamate in the urine and plasma, as well as variable intellectual, developmental, and hematological phenotypes. Glutamate formiminotransferase deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, which means that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent, to develop the condition. The FTCD gene is located on chromosome 21q22.3 and mutations in this gene can cause the deficiency. Glutamate formiminotransferase deficiency has several synonyms, including Arakawa syndrome 1, FIGLUria, FTCD deficiency, formiminoglutamic acidemia, and formiminoglutamic aciduria. It can also be referred to as formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase deficiency or glutamate formiminotransferase deficiency syndrome.<|end_of_text|>",11,True

It is caused by mutations in the KHK gene on chromosome 2p23.3, which encodes for the enzyme fructokinase. Essential fructosuria can lead to a variety of symptoms depending on the severity and how early it is diagnosed, including weight loss, weakness, fatigue, liver disease, and potentially life-threatening complications in severe cases.

Diffuse cystic renal dysplasia is a kind of inheritance where a mutation in one of your genes (BICC1 on chromosome 10q21.1) can cause it, and this mutation may also be present in unaffected parents who don't necessarily develop the disease. This condition is characterized by cystic kidney dysplasia that affects both kidneys, and has been defined as having a material basis in heterozygous mutations of BICC1 gene.

","Neurofibromatosis type 1, also known as NF1, is a genetic disorder that affects the nervous system and causes tumors to grow on nerve cells. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that if one parent has the gene, there is a 50% chance that their child will inherit it. NF1 typically occurs in people of all ages, but it is more common in children and young adults.

NF1 can cause a range of symptoms, including:

* Skin tumors called neurofibromas
* Freckling or brown spots on the skin (Lisch nodules)
* Bumps under the skin (papillomas)
* Weakness in muscles and bones (hypoplasia)
* Short stature
* Learning disabilities
* Ptosis (drooping eyelids)
* Scoliosis or other spinal deformities

NF1 is typically diagnosed based on a physical exam, medical history, and genetic testing. Treatment depends on the severity of symptoms and may include:

* Surgery to remove tumors (neurofibromas)
* Physical therapy to improve muscle strength and coordination
* Speech and language therapy for children with speech or language delays
* Medications to treat pain, seizures, or other symptoms

With proper treatment, most people with NF1 can lead a normal life. However, it is essential to monitor the condition closely and work with healthcare providers to manage symptoms effectively.",17,True

Diagnosis requires a combination of clinical examination, genetic testing, and imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or optical coherence tomography (OCT). Treatment options for LHON include supportive care, antioxidant therapy, and gene replacement therapy. Gene replacement therapy involves the introduction of a healthy copy of the faulty mitochondrial DNA gene into the patient's cells using viral vectors.

SRXX2 is a form of autosomal dominant inheritance, which means that if one parent has the gene for it, there is a 50% chance that their offspring will inherit the condition. However, not all individuals with the gene will develop the disorder or experience its full range of symptoms.

To diagnose SRXX2, healthcare professionals may perform physical exams, genetic testing to determine chromosome structure and function, and endocrine evaluations to assess hormone levels. Treatment options for SRXX2 depend on the severity of the condition but can include medical interventions such as hormone replacement therapy or surgery to address specific issues related to sexual development.

","X-linked VATER (VACTERL) association is a type of genetic disorder that affects various organ systems in the body, primarily due to the presence of mutations on the X chromosome. It is characterized by the combination of four main congenital anomalies:

1. Vertebral anomalies (V) - abnormal formation or development of vertebrae in the spine.
2. Anal atresia (A) - absence or underdevelopment of the anus and rectum.
3. Tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) - an abnormal connection between the trachea and esophagus, which can lead to aspiration and infection.
4. Renal anomalies (R) - abnormalities in the formation or function of the kidneys.

X-linked VATER association is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner, which means that a male with this condition has one copy of the mutated gene (XY0), while a female with the condition has two copies of the mutated gene (XX0). Females who have only one copy of the mutated gene (X0) are usually carriers and can pass the gene on to their offspring.

The severity of X-linked VATER association varies depending on the specific genetic mutations present, but it can lead to a range of health problems, including respiratory distress, feeding difficulties, kidney issues, and hydrocephalus (in some cases). Treatment may involve surgery, medication, and other medical interventions to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.",6,True

","46 XY sex reversal, also known as 46 XX gonadal dysgenesis or partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS), is a genetic disorder characterized by the presence of one X and one Y chromosome in an individual's cells. This condition can result in a variety of developmental abnormalities, particularly related to reproductive organs and secondary sex characteristics.

46 XY sex reversal occurs when a person with normally developing male gonads (testes) has genetic factors that cause them to develop female reproductive organs (ovaries). This can lead to a combination of features typically associated with both male and female anatomy, such as the presence of ovarian tissue in addition to testicular tissue.

46 XY sex reversal is considered to be one form of Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), which affects individuals who are genetically male but have a partial or complete resistance to androgens, the hormones responsible for typical male development. In some cases, 46 XY sex reversal may also be accompanied by other genetic disorders or chromosomal abnormalities that can contribute to its development.

It is important to note that while 46 XY sex reversal is not a rare condition (with an estimated prevalence of 1 in every 2,000 to 3,000 male births), it may be underdiagnosed due to a lack of awareness and understanding of the condition. Proper diagnosis typically involves a combination of genetic testing, physical examination, and hormone analysis. Treatment options for individuals with 46 XY sex reversal can vary widely depending on their specific needs and goals, but may include hormone replacement therapy, gender-affirming surgeries, and psychological support to address issues related to self-esteem and body image.",9,True

AIS is characterized by the presence of male genitalia (e.g., a penis) at birth, but the individual may have internal female reproductive organs such as ovaries, uterus, and fallopian tubes. AIS can affect an individual's hormonal balance, causing issues with puberty, growth, and development.

Treatment for 46,XY sex reversal depends on the severity of the condition and the affected individual's overall health. In some cases, medical intervention may be necessary to induce female puberty or suppress male puberty if it has already begun. Additionally, hormone replacement therapy may be recommended to address any imbalances caused by the disorder.

","TARPS, or Tarp Syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder that affects many different organ systems in the body. It is characterized by several distinctive features, including talipes equinovarus (clubfoot), atrial septal defect (a hole in the heart), Robin sequence (micrognathia, cleft palate, and glossoptosis), and persistent left superior vena cava. These abnormalities often lead to late prenatal or early postnatal mortality. The disorder is caused by a hemizygous mutation in the RBM10 gene on chromosome Xp11.3, which provides material basis for the syndrome.
TARPS is also known as Pierre Robin sequence-congenital heart defect-talipes syndrome, Pierre Robin syndrome-congenital heart defect-talipes syndrome, or simply TARPS. It is important to note that this disorder can be misdiagnosed due to the overlapping symptoms with other genetic disorders. If you suspect that you or a loved one may have TARPS, it is crucial to consult with a medical professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.",8,True

","Syndactyly type 4, also known as Haas type syndactyly, is a condition characterized by the fusion of multiple fingers and/or toes. This type of syndactyly involves bilateral symmetry, meaning that the fusion occurs on both sides of the body. It typically affects the digits 1 through 5 and can involve other parts of the hand as well.

Syndactyly type 4 is an autosomal dominant disorder, which means that it can be inherited from one parent and can be passed on to offspring. The genetic basis of this condition involves a mutation in the SHH regulatory element in intron 5 of the LMBR1 gene on chromosome 7q36.3. This mutation leads to an imbalance in the production of certain proteins involved in limb development, resulting in the fusion of the affected digits.

In summary, Syndactyly type 4 is a genetic disorder characterized by the fusion of multiple fingers and/or toes due to a mutation in the SHH regulatory element in intron 5 of the LMBR1 gene on chromosome 7q36.3. It is an autosomal dominant disorder that can be inherited from one parent and affects the digits 1 through 5, as well as other parts of the hand.",7,True

PCD specifically impacts the motility of the cilia, causing them to move abnormally or not at all. This can lead to various problems, such as respiratory and sinus infections, infertility, and other health issues.
It is caused by mutations in the TTC12 gene, which is located on chromosome 11q23.2. The condition is inherited from affected parents and can affect both males and females equally. It's important to note that not all individuals with PCD have situs inversus (mirror-image reversal of the normal orientation of the body structures).
PCD can also cause other health issues such as bronchiectasis, a condition where the airways become wider and can lead to lung infections.",6,True

","Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the production of red blood cells. It occurs when there are mutations in one or more of the genes responsible for producing these blood cells, specifically in the ribosome protein synthesis pathway. There are two types of DBA: autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant.

DBA17 is a specific type of Diamond-Blackfan anemia that has a material basis in heterozygous mutation in the RPS27 gene on chromosome 1q21.3. This means that if one parent passes on the faulty gene, there is a 50% chance that their child will inherit the condition. It affects both males and females equally.

Symptoms of DBA17 typically appear during infancy or early childhood and include anemia, bone deformations such as leg abnormalities (dysplasia), and a higher risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Treatment usually involves blood transfusions and antibiotics to prevent infections.

In summary, Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a rare genetic disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance that affects the production of red blood cells due to mutations in ribosome protein synthesis pathway genes.

","Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare genetic disorder that primarily affects the bone marrow and blood cells. It is characterized by a lack of normal blood cells, particularly red blood cells, which can lead to anemia. DBA can be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner or it can occur spontaneously without any family history of the disease.
DBA has been linked to mutations in several genes, with one of the most common being the RPS24 gene located on chromosome 10q22.3. The RPS24 protein plays a role in ribosome biogenesis and is essential for cell growth and development. Mutations in this gene can disrupt the normal functioning of the ribosome, leading to the development of DBA.
There are different types of DBA, each with unique genetic and clinical features. Diamond-Blackfan anemia 3 (DBA3) is one such type, characterized by a specific mutation in the RPS24 gene. This type of DBA has been shown to have a material basis in heterozygous mutations in the RPS24 gene and is sometimes referred to as RPS24-related DBA.

There are different subtypes of DBA, including DBA 15, which is associated with mandibulofacial dysostosis.
DBA 15 is a specific type of Diamond-Blackfan anemia characterized by the presence of mandibulofacial dysostosis, which includes micrognathia, downslanting palpebral fissures, submucosal cleft palate or bifid uvula, and malar hypoplasia. These features are due to a mutation in the RPS28 gene on chromosome 19p13.2.
In summary, DBA 15 is a subtype of Diamond-Blackfan anemia that is defined by the presence of mandibulofacial dysostosis and is caused by a mutation in the RPS28 gene.",5,True

Diamond-Blackfan anemia 1 is caused by a mutation in the RPS19 gene on chromosome 19q13.2, which leads to the production of abnormal ribosomes. This type of DBA primarily affects children and has a high risk of leukemia.
Diamond-Blackfan anemia 2 is caused by a mutation in the erythroid-specific gene EBF1 on chromosome 16q22.1, which leads to abnormal erythroblast development. This type of DBA primarily affects adults and has a higher risk of developing chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).
Both types of DBA require lifelong monitoring and treatment by healthcare professionals to manage anemia and prevent complications such as organ damage or infections.",6,True

","Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the bone marrow and blood cells.

DBA can occur in different types, including Diamond-Blackfan anemia 14, which is one type that has a specific combination of symptoms like bilateral microtia (small outer ear), cleft palate, and mandibulofacial dysostosis (abnormal development of the jaw bones).

DBA is usually inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern, which means that a male inherits the gene from his mother or a female inherits it from her father. In some cases, the disorder may also occur due to a new genetic change (de novo) in affected individuals who don't have any family history of DBA.

Treatment for DBA usually focuses on addressing the underlying cause and managing symptoms. This can include blood transfusions, growth hormone therapy, pain management, and surgery to correct any abnormalities in bone development. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial in managing the condition effectively and improving overall health outcomes for individuals with DBA.",5,True

Spermatogenic failure can occur due to various factors such as genetic, environmental, or medical conditions, and can have a significant impact on an individual's reproductive health. If you are experiencing spermatogenic failure, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment options.",5,True

The condition has a genetic basis, with mutations in the PIK3CD gene on chromosome 1p36.22 being the most common cause of the disorder. These mutations lead to the production of an abnormal protein that disrupts normal immune function.

Immunodeficiency 14 is also known by several other names, including APDS (Ataxia with Progressive Diaphyses), IMD14 (Immune Deficiency Syndrome with Multiple Infections), and PASLI disease. It is important to note that these terms are synonymous and all refer to the same condition.

It is characterized by undetectable levels of interleukin 12 (IL-12) secreted by white blood cells and an increased susceptibility to intracellular bacterial infections. This condition has a genetic basis, with mutations in the IL-12B gene on chromosome 5q33.3 being the primary cause. It is also known as Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases due to complete IL-12B deficiency or MSMD due to complete interleukin 12B deficiency.",11,True
