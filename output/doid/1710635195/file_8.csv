Patients with DCM1R often present at an earlier age than those with other subtypes of DCM, and may have larger left ventricles and thicker walls in the heart. The disease can progress slowly or rapidly, depending on the severity of the mutation and the overall health of the individual.

Treatment options for DCM1R typically include medications to improve heart function and reduce symptoms, such as beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and ACE inhibitors. In some cases, a pacemaker may be implanted to regulate abnormal heart rhythms. Surgical interventions, such as cardiac transplantation or the placement of an assist device, may also be considered for advanced cases.

","Autosomal recessive nonsyndromic deafness 104 is a genetic disorder that affects the hearing of an individual. It is caused by mutations in the FAM65B gene, which is located on chromosome 6p22. This type of deafness is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning that to have full penetrance, a person must inherit two copies of the gene (one from each parent).

Autosomal recessive nonsyndromic deafness 104, also known as DFNB104, is a specific form of autosomal recessive nonsyndromic deafness. It does not cause any other physical or developmental abnormalities, unlike some other forms of this disorder.

It's important to note that the term ""DFNB104"" stands for Decibel Function Naive Base 104, which is a genetic nomenclature system used to identify specific genes associated with hearing loss. This system uses a base-10 numbering system to assign unique numbers to different genes that are responsible for inherited deafness.

Overall, autosomal recessive nonsyndromic deafness 104 is a relatively rare condition, but it can have significant impacts on an individual's quality of life. Early detection and intervention with appropriate hearing aids or cochlear implants can help minimize the effects of this disorder.",4,True

PCD can cause various symptoms, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and asthma. It is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, which means that a person needs to inherit two copies of the abnormal gene (one from each parent) in order to develop the disorder.
PCD can be caused by mutations in several genes, including CCDC65 on chromosome 12q13, which is responsible for producing a protein called CILD27. This protein plays a role in cilia function and regulation of cell movement.
Some people with PCD may have Situs Inversus, which means that their internal organs are positioned in the opposite direction compared to what is typically seen in most individuals. However, not all cases of PCD will have this condition.
PCD can be diagnosed through a combination of genetic testing, physical examination, and imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT) scans or bronchoscopy. Treatment for PCD usually focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications, such as infections or exacerbation of asthma. This may include bronchodilators, corticosteroids, antibiotics, and other medications as needed. In some cases, lung transplantation may be considered for severe cases that are not well controlled with medical therapy.
Overall, PCD is a rare disorder that can have significant impact on an individual's health and quality of life. With proper diagnosis and management, however, people with PCD can lead full and fulfilling lives.",4,True

Cilia play an important role in many bodily functions such as breathing, digestion, and transportation of molecules. In PCD4, the absence or dysfunction of cilia can lead to a variety of health problems including respiratory infections, infertility, and developmental abnormalities.

Diagnosis of PCD4 typically involves a combination of genetic testing, imaging studies, and clinical evaluation. Treatment options depend on the specific symptoms present but may include medications to manage breathing issues, assistive devices for mobility, and surgery in some cases. It is important for individuals with PCD4 to work closely with their healthcare provider to develop an individualized treatment plan tailored to their needs.

","Ciliary dyskinesia, also known as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), is a rare genetic disorder that affects the movement of cilia, which are small hair-like structures found on the surface of most cells in the body. Cilia play a crucial role in several essential functions such as breathing, digestion, and fighting off infections. In PCD, these cilia do not work properly, leading to a range of problems including respiratory infections, sinusitis, and infertility.
PCD is genetically inherited and is caused by mutations in one of the many genes involved in cilia function. There are several types of PCD, each with its own specific genetic cause. One such type is primary ciliary dyskinesia 8 (CILD8), which is characterized by a variation in the chromosome region 15q24-q25.
Situs inversus is another condition that can be associated with PCD, where the major organs of the body are located on the opposite side than usual. While it may coexist with CILD8, situs inversus does not have a specific genetic cause and can occur without any underlying genetic abnormality.
In summary, primary ciliary dyskinesia 8 is a type of PCD that results from a variation in the chromosome region 15q24-q25, and it may be associated with situs inversus but does not have a specific genetic cause.",4,True

The exact cause of congenital myasthenic syndrome 3b is not known, but it is believed to be related to an autoimmune response that affects the communication between nerves and muscles. This leads to a decrease in the transmission of nerve impulses at the neuromuscular junction, resulting in weakness.
Treatment for congenital myasthenic syndrome 3b usually involves the use of medications that improve nerve function and prevent the immune system from attacking the nervous system. These medications can help to manage symptoms and improve quality of life for individuals with this condition. In some cases, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy may also be used to treat the disorder.

This results in muscle weakness and fatigue that can worsen with activity and improve with rest.

CMS11 is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that a person needs to inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the condition.

","Hypotrichosis 1 is a type of autosomal dominant disease, which means it is passed down through genes on the autosomal chromosomes (non-sex chromosomes) from generation to generation. It is caused by a mutation in the APCDD1 gene located on chromosome 18p11.22. The condition has the name ""hypotrichosis"" because it causes abnormal hair growth or lack of hair growth, specifically on the scalp and eyelashes.
Hypotrichosis 1 can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that if one parent has the gene mutation, there is a chance that their child may inherit it. It is also possible for a person without the gene mutation to develop the condition if they are exposed to certain environmental factors or have other genetic predispositions.
Overall, hypotrichosis 1 is a rare and genetically determined disorder characterized by sparse hair growth on the scalp and eyelashes due to a defect in hair follicle development.",8,True

","Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, leading to high blood sugar levels. It is also known as juvenile onset diabetes or insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). T1D typically develops during childhood and adolescence, although it can occur at any age.

In T1D, the immune system attacks and destroys the beta cells in the pancreas that produce insulin, leading to a lack of insulin production. As a result, glucose cannot be effectively absorbed by the body's cells, causing high blood sugar levels. T1D requires lifelong treatment with insulin to manage blood sugar levels and prevent long-term complications such as blindness, nerve damage, kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease.

While there is no cure for T1D, advancements in diabetes research have made it possible to improve the quality of life for individuals living with the condition. Treatment options include insulin therapy, blood glucose monitoring, and lifestyle modifications such as a healthy diet and regular physical activity. Additionally, new technologies like continuous glucose monitors (CGM) and insulin pumps can help individuals better manage their blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of complications.

In summary, Type 1 diabetes mellitus is a chronic autoimmune disease that results from the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. It requires lifelong treatment with insulin to manage blood sugar levels and prevent long-term complications.

","Type 1 diabetes mellitus is a type of diabetes mellitus that is characterized by the inability to produce insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. It typically occurs in children and young adults, although it can also affect older individuals. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder, which means that the body's immune system attacks the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. This leads to a lack of insulin production and high blood sugar levels.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus is caused by mutations in the HNF1A gene, which is located on chromosome 12q24.31. These mutations disrupt the function of the HNF1A protein, which is important for pancreatic beta cell function and insulin production.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus is also known as IDDM (Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus) or juvenile onset diabetes. It requires lifelong treatment with insulin injections or an insulin pump to maintain normal blood sugar levels.

Over time, type 1 diabetes can lead to complications such as blindness, kidney disease, and nerve damage if left untreated. However, with proper care and management, individuals with type 1 diabetes can live a relatively normal lifespan.",4,True

","type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a chronic condition characterized by high blood sugar levels due to the inability of the pancreas to produce enough insulin. It is an autoimmune disorder, which means that the immune system attacks and destroys the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. This results in a lack of insulin production and the body's inability to regulate blood sugar levels properly.

There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 is an autoimmune disorder, while type 2 is typically associated with lifestyle factors such as obesity and a lack of physical activity. However, both types can be managed through proper diet, exercise, and medication.

In the case of T1DM, it is important for individuals to carefully monitor their blood sugar levels and work closely with their healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment. This may include insulin therapy, regular meal planning, and physical activity. By managing their condition effectively, people with T1DM can lead a normal, active life.",4,True

","Type 1 diabetes mellitus, also known as IDDM, is a type of diabetes that results from the body's inability to produce enough insulin. It typically affects children and young adults, although it can occur at any age. Type 1 diabetes is caused by a genetic predisposition and an environmental trigger, such as a viral infection.

In type 1 diabetes mellitus, the immune system attacks the beta cells of the pancreas, which produce insulin. As a result, the body is unable to regulate blood sugar levels, leading to high levels of glucose in the bloodstream. Type 1 diabetes requires lifelong treatment with insulin therapy and careful monitoring of blood sugar levels to prevent complications such as blindness, kidney damage, and nerve damage.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus has a genetic basis and is caused by mutations in the genes that control insulin production. It can be inherited from one or both parents, although the exact genetic makeup of an individual cannot be determined solely by their family history. In some cases, type 1 diabetes may develop without any clear genetic link, suggesting that other environmental factors may have played a role in its development.

Overall, type 1 diabetes mellitus is a complex disease with multiple contributing factors. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to preventing long-term complications and maintaining good health.",4,True

","Hereditary spastic paraplegia 10, also known as SPG10, is a type of autosomal dominant disease that affects the body's motor function. It is characterized by progressive weakness and stiffness in the legs and can also impact other parts of the body. The condition is caused by mutations in the KIF5A gene on chromosome 12q13, which provides instructions for making a protein involved in muscle movement. This protein plays a role in maintaining the structure and function of microtubules, which are essential for muscle contraction. When this protein is not functioning properly, it can lead to the development of hereditary spastic paraplegia 10.

There is currently no cure for hereditary spastic paraplegia 10, but treatment options are available to manage the symptoms and improve quality of life. These may include physical therapy, medication, and assistive devices such as wheelchairs or walkers. It is important to work with a healthcare professional to develop an individualized treatment plan that addresses the specific needs and goals of each person affected by this condition.

Genetic counseling can also be beneficial for individuals who have a family history of hereditary spastic paraplegia 10 or are considering having children. Genetic counselors can help to understand the risks associated with passing on the genetic mutation and discuss options such as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) or prenatal testing for at-risk individuals.

It is an autosomal dominant condition, meaning that if one parent has the gene mutation, there is a 50% chance that the offspring will inherit the gene and develop the disease. The onset of symptoms typically occurs in adulthood, with some cases presenting later in life or even during childhood.

The HSPD1 gene located on chromosome 2q33 is responsible for producing a protein called ""heterogeneous spastic paraplegia protein 1."" This protein plays an important role in maintaining the health and function of motor neurons, which are nerve cells that control movement. A mutation or alteration in this gene can lead to the development of Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia Type 13.

Symptoms of HSPD13 may include muscle stiffness, spasms, and weakness in the legs and lower back. The disease can also affect other body parts such as arms, hands, and even the face. Some patients may experience cognitive decline or depression as well.

Although there is no cure for this genetic disorder, early diagnosis and proper management of symptoms can improve quality of life. Treatment options may include physical therapy, medications to alleviate pain and spasticity, and assistive devices such as wheelchairs or walkers. Additionally, support from healthcare professionals and a support group can help individuals living with HSPD13 navigate the challenges of their condition.",6,True

","Hereditary spastic paraplegia 24, also known as SPG24 or autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 24, is a genetic disorder that affects movement and can cause weakness in the legs. It is caused by mutations in the CHST14 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called cholesterol sulfate transporter 1. This protein is involved in the transport of cholesterol within cells and plays a role in the development and maintenance of myelin, a fatty substance that insulates nerve cells and promotes their proper functioning. When the CHST14 gene is mutated, it can lead to a deficiency of cholesterol sulfate transporter 1, which may disrupt the normal functioning of myelin and result in spastic paraplegia.",7,True

","Hereditary spastic paraplegia 41, also known as SPG41 and autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia type 41, is a genetic disorder that affects the muscles in the lower extremities. It is caused by mutations in the CHRFA2 gene, which is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 9 at position 11.2. The condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the disorder. Symptoms typically begin in childhood and progress slowly over time, leading to spasticity, weakness, and problems with balance and coordination. There is no cure for hereditary spastic paraplegia 41, but physical therapy and other forms of treatment can help manage the symptoms.",7,True

This leads to an accumulation of dihydroxyacetonephosphate (DHAP) in the mitochondria, resulting in impaired energy production and skeletal abnormalities.

Symptoms of rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 2 include short stature, bone deformities, and joint problems. The severity of the condition can vary greatly depending on the specific gene mutation and the individual's overall health. Treatment may involve medications to manage pain and improve mobility, as well as physical therapy to help maintain muscle strength and flexibility. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to correct bone deformities.

Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for managing the symptoms of rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 2 and improving quality of life. Genetic counseling can also help individuals understand the risks and implications of the condition for themselves and their families.",9,True

Autosomal dominant inheritance means that the gene responsible for this condition can be passed down from one generation to another through either parent, with a 50% chance of passing it on to each offspring. This type of inheritance is seen in families with a history of night blindness and other eye-related problems.

Congenital stationary night blindness autosomal dominant 1 specifically refers to the presence of mutations in the RHO gene, which is located on chromosome 3q22.1.

","Congenital stationary night blindness 1a (CSNB1A) is a type of congenital stationary night blindness, which refers to a group of inherited disorders that affect vision. It is an X-linked recessive disease, meaning that it is passed down through the mother's X chromosome and can cause vision problems in males if both of their X chromosomes have the mutated gene. CSNB1A has a material basis in a mutation in the NYX gene on chromosome Xp11.4, which provides instructions for making a protein involved in regulating light sensitivity in the retina.

CSNB1A is characterized by difficulty seeing in low light conditions, such as at night or in dimly lit rooms, and can also cause myopia (nearsightedness) in some cases. It has the exact synonyms CSNB1A, NBMI, complete CSNB X-linked, congenital stationary night blindness 1A X-linked, congenital stationary night blindness with myopia, hemeralopia-myopia, and myopia-night blindness.

It is important to note that while CSNB1A has a material basis in a mutation in the NYX gene, it also has a disease basis in an abnormality of prenatal development or birth. This means that the disorder affects the way an individual's eye develops during fetal life and can result in vision problems at birth or in early childhood.

In summary, Congenital stationary night blindness 1a (CSNB1A) is a type of congenital stationary night blindness that results from a mutation in the NYX gene on chromosome Xp11.4. It affects vision by causing difficulty seeing in low light conditions and, in some cases, myopia.",12,True

IBD2 can be diagnosed through genetic testing that looks for specific changes in the ZO-1 gene, as well as through clinical assessment of symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding. Treatment options may include anti-inflammatory medications, immunosuppressants, and surgery.

The symptoms of infantile hypophosphatasia can vary widely depending on the severity of the enzyme deficiency. Some infants may have mild symptoms and grow normally, while others may have severe symptoms that can lead to life-threatening complications if left untreated.

","Familial Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to regulate its immune system. It occurs when a person inherits two abnormal copies of the gene responsible for creating a protein called CD59, which helps protect cells from viruses and bacteria. There are several types of FHL, and each type is determined by which specific gene is affected.
FHL4 is one type of FHL that is caused by a mutation in the STX11 gene on chromosome 6q24.2. It typically affects children and young adults and can lead to severe complications if not treated properly. Symptoms may include fever, rash, swollen lymph nodes, liver and spleen enlargement, and in some cases, bleeding. Diagnosis is made through a combination of medical history, physical exams, blood tests, and genetic testing. Treatment typically involves reducing the immune system's response to the body's self-defense mechanisms, as well as treating any underlying infections or viruses that may be causing symptoms.

","Nemaline myopathy type 6 (also known as congenital nemaline myopathy) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the muscles in the body. It is characterized by progressive weakness of the muscles, particularly those in the arms and legs, which can lead to difficulty with movement and coordination. This condition is caused by mutations in the KBTBD13 gene, which is located on chromosome 15q22. It typically affects children and has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, meaning that if one parent has the gene, there is a 50% chance that their child will inherit it. Exercise intolerance is also often present in individuals with this condition.",7,True

","Nemaline myopathy 5a, also known as Amish nemaline myopathy (ANM) or NEM5, is a type of autosomal recessive disease that affects the muscles. It is caused by a homozygous mutation in the TNNT1 gene on chromosome 19q13 and typically presents with an infantile onset. The condition has a material basis in autosomal recessive inheritance, which means that it is passed down through families and can be inherited from affected individuals. It is characterized by severe muscle weakness, particularly affecting the legs, neck, and facial muscles. Treatment options may include physical therapy, medications, and respiratory support as needed.",9,True

","Autosomal dominant osteopetrosis 1 (OPTA1) is a type of autosomal dominant disease where the inheritance pattern is passed down through the autosome chromosomes, rather than the sex chromosomes. This means that both males and females can be affected by this condition, which is caused by mutations in the LRP5 gene on chromosome 11q13.
OPTA1 is characterized by the development of osteosclerosis, which is the hardening and thickening of bone tissue. This occurs due to an increase in osteoclast activity and a decrease in osteoblast activity. Osteosclerosis typically affects the cranial vault, but can also occur in other parts of the body.
People with OPTA1 may experience symptoms such as headaches, hearing loss, and visual disturbances due to the pressure caused by the thickened bone tissue on the skull. There is a higher risk of fractures in individuals with this condition, but these tend to be more spontaneous and not related to trauma.
Overall, OPTA1 is a rare genetic disorder that can have significant impacts on an individual's health and quality of life. It is important for those affected by this condition to work closely with their healthcare providers to manage their symptoms and ensure proper care.",6,True
