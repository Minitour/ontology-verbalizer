This infection is also characterized by symptoms such as fever, headache, abdominal pain, and a maculopapular rash that can progress into a papular or petechial rash. Additionally, Rocky Mountain spotted fever is associated with a material basis in Rickettsia rickettsii and is transmitted through tick-borne transmission, including Dermacentor variabilis, Dermacentor andersoni, and other forms of tick-borne transmission. The fever's symptoms include abdominal pain, headache, fever, maculopapular rash, and papular rash.

Rocky Mountain spotted fever is also known by several related synonyms, including Brazilian spotted, Choix, Exanthematic typhus of Sao Paulo, Fiebre maculosa, Fiebre manchada, Sao Paulo typhus, So Paulo fever, and Tobia fever, indicating its recognition and identification across different regions and languages.",20,True

Dengue Shock Syndrome is characterized by symptoms such as bleeding, hypotension, epistaxis (nosebleeds), shock, nasal bleeding, and gum bleeding. Additionally, the infection is known for causing easy bruising, blood spots, bleeding gums, and nosebleeds. It involves circulatory collapse, hypotension, narrow pulse pressure (less than or equal to 20 mm Hg), or frank shock, occurring after two to six days of initial symptoms. This leads to collapse, weak pulse, and blueness around the mouth.",10,True
