","Histiocytosis lymphadenopathy plus syndrome is a type of syndrome, specifically an autosomal recessive disease, which has a material basis in some autosomal recessive inheritance and symptoms including hepatosplenomegaly. This syndrome is characterized by a range of symptoms: histiocytosis, hyperpigmentation, hypertrichosis, hepatosplenomegaly, heart anomalies, hearing loss, hypogonadism, and reduced height. It is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutation in the SLC29A3 gene located on chromosome 10q22.1. Notably, this syndrome encompasses features of four histiocytic disorders previously considered distinct: Faisalabad histiocytosis, sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy (SHML), H syndrome, and pigmented hypertrichosis with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus syndrome.

The syndrome is also known by several exact synonyms, including Faisalabad histiocytosis, H syndrome, HJCD, PHID, Rosai–Dorfman disease, SHML, cutaneous hyperpigmentation with hypertrichosis, hepatosplenomegaly, heart anomalies, and hypogonadism with or without hearing loss, familial Rosai-Dorfman disease, histiocytosis and lymphadenopathy with or without cutaneous, cardiac, and/or endocrine features, joint contractures and/or deafness, histiocytosis with joint contractures and sensorineural deafness, pigmented hypertrichosis with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and sinus histiocytosis and massive lymphadenopathy.",17,True

These symptoms arise due to its material basis in homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the IDUA gene on chromosome 4p16.3. Additionally, mucopolysaccharidosis IH/S is associated with autosomal recessive inheritance, and its symptoms notably include hepatosplenomegaly, cloudy cornea, and short stature. The disease also features umbilical hernia. Moreover, mucopolysaccharidosis IH/S is also known by its exact synonyms MPS1H/S, MPSIH/S, and Mucopolysaccharidosis type 1H/S.",11,True
