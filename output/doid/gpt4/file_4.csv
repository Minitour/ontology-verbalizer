","Borrelia miyamotoi disease, also known as BMD or hard tick-borne relapsing fever, is a primary bacterial infectious disease.

The disease manifests with several symptoms such as fever, headache, chills, muscle pain, joint pain, asthenia (weakness), fatigue, and nausea. These symptoms highlight the impact of the infection on the body, sometimes leading to rarely observed relapses. Notably, Borrelia miyamotoi disease is recognized in the medical community with the identifiers SNOMEDCT_US_2023_03_01:713014002 and UMLS_CUI:C4076531, ensuring a standardized approach to its diagnosis and treatment.",17,True

It is characterized by having a material basis in some autosomal dominant inheritance and manifests a phenotype of increased bone mineral density. The condition is defined as a hyperostosis that results from a mutation in the LRP5 gene, leading to increased bone density and bony structures located in the palate. Worth syndrome is also known by several exact synonyms, including Worth's syndrome, autosomal dominant endosteal hyperostosis, autosomal dominant osteosclerosis, and the benign form of Worth hyperostosis corticalis generalisata with torus platinus.",9,True

","Metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease is a specific type of steatotic liver disease. It is defined as a steatotic liver disease characterized by the presence of at least one of five cardiometabolic risk factors (adjusted for age, sex, and ethnicity), alcohol consumption below 140g/week for females or 210g/week for males, and no other discernible cause. The five cardiometabolic risk factors include: a Body Mass Index (BMI) of ≥ 25 kg/m^2 for adults, 23 kg/m^2 for adult Asians, or at or above the 85th percentile for pediatric cases; a waist circumference greater than 94 cm for adult males, 80 cm for adult females, or at or above the 95th percentile for pediatric cases; fasting serum glucose levels of ≥ 5.6 mmol/L, 2-hour post-load glucose levels of ≥ 7.8 mmol/L, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of ≥ 5.7% (39 mmol/mol), type 2 diabetes, treatment for type 2 diabetes, previously diagnosed or treated type 2 diabetes in pediatric cases, or serum glucose levels of ≥ 11.1 mmol/L in pediatric cases; blood pressure at or above the lower of 130/85 mmHg or the 95th percentile for those under 13 years of age, or 130/85 mmHg for those aged 13 years or older; plasma triglycerides levels of ≥ 1.15 mmol/L for those under 10 years of age or 1.70 mmol/L for those aged 10 years or older; and plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of ≤ 1.0 mmol/L for adult males and pediatric cases, or ≤ 1.3 mmol/L for adult females. Additionally, metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease is exactly synonymous with a number of terms, including MAFLD, MASLD, NAFLD, metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease, metabolic dysfunction-related steatotic liver disease, metabolic-associated fatty liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.",10,True
