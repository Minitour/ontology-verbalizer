","Thiel Behnke corneal dystrophy, also known exactly as TBCD, Waardenburg-Jonker corneal dystrophy, anterior limiting membrane dystrophy type II, corneal dystrophy honeycomb-shaped, and corneal dystrophy of Bowman layer type II, is a type of autosomal dominant disease, specifically an epithelial stromal TGFBI dystrophy. It is characterized by recurrent erosions and honeycomb-shaped opacification located in the cornea, proteinaceous deposits in the anterior stroma and subepithelium, and progressive early vision loss. This condition has a material basis in autosomal dominant inheritance of heterozygous mutation of the transforming growth factor beta-induced gene located on chromosome 5q31.1, which encodes keratoepithelin. The abnormalities lead to increased protein deposition and disruption, especially of Bowman's membrane of the cornea.",9,True
