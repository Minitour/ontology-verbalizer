","Aqueous misdirection is a type of glaucoma characterized by a shallowing of the central and peripheral anterior chamber due to posterior pressure, resulting in inappropriately elevated intraocular pressure. This condition leads to optic nerve damage and visual field loss, with symptoms including some pain, loss of vision, bloodshot eyes, and headache. Additionally, aqueous misdirection is associated with features like ocular hypertension. The disease is caused by an abnormal relationship between the ciliary body, lens, and anterior vitreous, which diverts aqueous flow into the posterior segment, thereby increasing posterior pressure and further closing the angle.

","Di George syndrome is a type of syndrome, which is an autosomal dominant disease and also a chromosomal deletion syndrome. It is characterized by an intersection of characteristics that include at least having a material basis in some deletion and in some chromosome, specifically having a basis in autosomal dominant inheritance and in some gene-related disease. Di George syndrome is defined as a syndrome that has its material basis in a large deletion of the chromosome 22q11.2 region, which includes the DGS gene necessary for the development of the thymus and related glands, leading to a lack of T-cell production. Furthermore, Di George syndrome is known by several exact synonyms, including 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, DiGeorge sequence, DiGeorge's syndrome, and Pharyngeal pouch syndrome.",11,True
