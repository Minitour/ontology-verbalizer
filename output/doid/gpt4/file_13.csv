It primarily targets small and medium-size blood vessels, leading to significant complications in the lungs, kidneys, and skin as a result of an autoimmune attack by antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Furthermore, this disease is also known by its exact synonyms: Necrotizing respiratory granulomatosis and formerly as Wegener granulomatosis.",13,True
