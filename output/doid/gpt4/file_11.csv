","Cysticercosis is a type of taeniasis, as well as a type of muscular, heart, central nervous system, skin, and eye disease. It is characterized by being an intersection of diseases that affect various body zones, specifically the skin, heart, eye, central nervous system, and muscle tissue. Cysticercosis is defined as a taeniasis that results from the ingestion of eggs or larvae of the Taenia solium tapeworm found in undercooked pork or fecally contaminated food or water. This leads to infections in the central nervous system, heart, muscles, subcutaneous tissues, and eyes. Notably, neurocysticercosis, a manifestation of the disease, can cause seizures, mental disturbances, focal neurological deficits, and intracerebral lesions. Cysticercosis is also known by several exact synonyms, including Pork tapeworm infection, Tapeworm infection intestinal taenia solum, Tapeworm infection pork, Intestinal taenia solium infection, Neurocysticercosis, and Tenia solium infectious disease.",14,True
