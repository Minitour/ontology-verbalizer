","Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome 12 (CMS12), also precisely known as congenital myasthenia 12 with tubular aggregates, is a specific type of congenital myasthenic syndrome. It is categorized as an autosomal recessive disease, indicating that it has a material basis in autosomal recessive inheritance. Moreover, CMS12 is characterized by having symptoms that include muscle weakness and is based on abnormalities of prenatal development or birth. The definition of CMS12 highlights that it is a congenital myasthenic syndrome distinguished by autosomal recessive inheritance, where the onset of proximal muscle weakness occurs in the first decade and generally responds well to acetylcholinesterase inhibitor treatment. This condition is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutation in the GFPT1 gene on chromosome 2p13.",8,True
