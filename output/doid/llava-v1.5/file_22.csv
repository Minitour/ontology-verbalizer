2. Stroke - occurs when blood flow is disrupted to the brain, leading to cell death and potential long-term damage.
3. Multiple sclerosis - an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system, causing inflammation, demyelination, and eventual nerve damage.
4. Parkinson's disease - a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the brain.
5. Alzheimer's disease - a progressive neurological disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior due to the buildup of abnormal protein deposits in the brain.

","Prostate carcinoma in situ, also known as high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), is a precancerous condition of the prostate gland. It is characterized by abnormal cell growth within the glandular tissue of the prostate.

Prostate carcinoma in situ is considered to be one step below invasive cancer, but it still has the potential to progress to a more advanced stage if left untreated. Therefore, it is important for individuals with HGPIN to undergo regular monitoring and possibly further treatment depending on their specific case.

In summary, prostate carcinoma in situ is a type of in situ carcinoma that occurs within the prostate gland and can progress to more advanced stages if left untreated.",7,True

","acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer that affects the bone marrow and blood. It is characterized by the uncontrolled production of abnormal white blood cells, which can lead to anemia, infections, and easy bleeding. AML can be classified into two main types: acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and acute megakaryocytic leukemia.

Acute megakaryocytic leukemia is a subtype of AML that involves the proliferation of large numbers of megakaryocytes, which are cells in the bone marrow that give rise to platelets. These patients often have low levels of platelets in their blood and may experience excessive bleeding or bruising. In addition, acute megakaryocytic leukemia can cause bone pain and swelling due to the accumulation of abnormal megakaryocytes in the bone marrow.

AML is generally considered a serious disease, and treatment options may vary depending on the specific subtype and extent of the cancer. Common treatments for AML include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, stem cell transplantation, and targeted therapies. With advances in research and treatment, the outlook for AML patients has been improving over time. However, it is still crucial to seek medical attention promptly if you experience symptoms of AML or have concerns about your blood cells or bone marrow.",4,True

* Being male: Boys are at a higher risk than girls.
* Age: Infants between 1 and 4 months of age are at the highest risk.
* Socioeconomic status: Infants from low-income families are at higher risk.
* Premature birth: Infants who were born prematurely are at a higher risk.
* Smoking during pregnancy: If one or both parents smoke, the risk of SIDS increases.
* Overheating: Being too hot can increase the risk of SIDS.

It is important to create a safe sleep environment for infants by ensuring that they sleep on their backs, in a separate crib or bassinet, and with minimal bedding and soft objects. This can help reduce the risk of SIDS. If you have any concerns about your baby's sleep, it is recommended to consult with your pediatrician.",6,True

In situ carcinoma refers to a cancer that is confined to the organ in which it formed (in this case, the liver), without spreading to other parts of the body. Biliary system refers to the bile ducts and gallbladder, which are part of the liver's bile production and secretion process.",6,True

It is important to note that LPPs are not true neoplasms, but rather represent a reactive process characterized by the proliferation and accumulation of cells with fibroblast-like features. The exact cause of LPP remains unknown; however, it may be associated with certain infections or autoimmune disorders.

LPPs are typically asymptomatic and discovered incidentally during imaging studies for unrelated conditions. When symptoms do occur, they can include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and jaundice. Diagnosis is often made through a combination of imaging techniques, such as ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI. A liver biopsy may also be performed to confirm the diagnosis.

Treatment for LPP usually involves surgical resection; however, some cases may be treated with percutaneous ethanol injection or radiofrequency ablation. In cases where the LPP is too widespread for surgery, liver transplantation may be considered as an option.

It is important to note that while LPPs are generally benign and do not spread beyond the liver, they can cause significant damage if left untreated. Therefore, it is crucial to seek medical attention if you suspect you have LPP or any other liver condition.",2,True

Symptoms of rectal prolapse may include a feeling of pressure or fullness in the rectum, difficulty passing stools, and a sensation that the stool is not fully eliminated from the body after each attempt. In some cases, rectal prolapse can cause constipation or fecal incontinence, where small amounts of stool leak out of the anus without warning.

Treatment for rectal prolapse depends on the underlying cause and severity of the condition. It may involve a combination of lifestyle changes, such as eating a high-fiber diet to soften the stool and avoiding straining during bowel movements, as well as medical treatments like bulk forming agents, sphincter training exercises, or surgery in severe cases.

HES can affect multiple organ systems, including the skin, joints, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and cardiovascular system.
HES is a rare condition that occurs when the body produces too many eosinophils, which are a type of white blood cell. These elevated levels of eosinophils can cause inflammation and lead to the destruction of tissues and organs over time. Symptoms of HES can vary widely depending on which organs are affected and the severity of the disease. However, some common symptoms include skin rashes or itching, joint pain or stiffness, chest pain or shortness of breath, gastrointestinal issues such as diarrhea or abdominal pain, and cardiovascular problems like heart palpitations or fluttering in the chest.
Diagnosis of HES typically involves a combination of blood tests, imaging studies (such as x-rays or CT scans), and biopsies to assess tissue damage. Treatment for HES may include medications to reduce eosinophil levels, corticosteroids to control inflammation, immunosuppressant drugs, and other medications to manage specific symptoms. In severe cases, stem cell transplantation or other treatments may be necessary.

Adrenal gland disease is considered an endocrine system disease because it involves the disruption of hormone production by the adrenal glands. There are several types of adrenal gland disease, including Addison's disease, Cushing's disease, and Conn's syndrome. Each type has its own specific causes and symptoms, but generally speaking, adrenal gland diseases can cause a range of symptoms related to hormone imbalances, such as fatigue, weakness, weight loss, and high blood pressure.

Treatment for adrenal gland disease depends on the specific type and severity of the disease. In some cases, medication may be used to replace or regulate hormone production, while in other cases, surgery may be necessary to remove affected gland tissue. It's important to work with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment for your specific case of adrenal gland disease.",3,True

Symptoms of bulbar polio include difficulty breathing, difficulty speaking, difficulty swallowing, and difficulty chewing. These symptoms may also be accompanied by weakness in the arms, legs, or both, as well as muscle stiffness or spasticity. Bulbar polio can lead to long-term complications if not treated promptly and effectively.

Treatment for bulbar polio typically involves supportive care measures such as mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, and/or gastrostomy tube placement to assist with breathing. In addition, medications may be used to help manage symptoms, including muscle relaxants, antispasmodics, or dantrolene to alleviate spasticity. Physical therapy and speech therapy are also essential in helping patients recover from the effects of bulbar polio and regain as much function as possible.

Prevention measures include routine vaccination against poliovirus, proper handwashing techniques, and avoiding contact with anyone who has symptoms of poliovirus infection.

","Choroidal angioid streaks, also known as choroidal neovascularization (CNV) or subretinal neovascularization (SNV), is a condition in which new blood vessels grow under the retina. It is a common cause of vision loss in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

Choroidal angioid streaks can be caused by genetic factors, such as mutations in the complement factor H gene or the HTRA1 gene. Other risk factors for developing choroidal angioid streaks include smoking, high blood pressure, and having a family history of AMD.

The condition typically affects both eyes but may not cause significant vision loss until later in life. Symptoms can include blurry or distorted vision, scotomata (blind spots), and/or metamorphopsia (visual distortions). Early detection and treatment of choroidal angioid streaks are important to prevent further vision loss. Treatment options may include photodynamic therapy, laser treatments, intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF drugs, and/or surgery.

In conclusion, choroidal angioid streaks is a condition in which new blood vessels grow under the retina, often associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

","Galactosemia is a rare genetic disorder caused by the deficiency of an enzyme called galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT). GALT is responsible for converting galactose into a usable form in the body. When this enzyme is missing or not functioning properly, it can lead to an excessive buildup of galactose and galactose-1-phosphate in the body's tissues, particularly the brain. This excess can cause damage to the nervous system and other organs, resulting in a range of developmental problems and health issues.
Galactosemia is diagnosed through newborn screening tests that check for elevated levels of galactose-1-phosphate in the blood. Treatment typically involves a strict low-galactose diet to reduce the excess galactose in the body, along with monitoring and management of symptoms. In severe cases, hospitalization may be necessary.
It's important for individuals with galactosemia to work closely with healthcare professionals to manage their condition effectively and maintain a healthy lifestyle.",4,True

    :has_definition ""A substance-related disorder that involves the continued use of alcohol or other drugs despite problems related to use of the substance."" .

","Substance dependence, also known as substance use disorder, is a medical condition characterized by a problematic pattern of using drugs or alcohol that leads to clinically significant impairment or distress. It is defined as a chronic, relapsing brain disease that affects a person's ability to control their use of drugs or alcohol. The disorder is often associated with physical and psychological dependence on the substance, as well as negative emotional states such as anxiety, depression, and mood swings.

Substance dependence can be diagnosed using a standardized assessment tool such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), which is published by the American Psychiatric Association. The DSM-5 outlines specific criteria that must be met for a substance use disorder diagnosis, including the pattern of use, the amount used, and the negative consequences experienced due to the use of the substance.

Substance dependence can be treated using a combination of medications, therapy, and support groups. Medications such as methadone or buprenorphine can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms and reduce cravings for opioids, while psychotherapeutic approaches like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and contingency management can help individuals develop coping skills and manage their substance use. Support groups, such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anonymous (NA), provide a social network of peers who are also struggling with substance dependence, and can be an important component of recovery.

In summary, substance dependence is a chronic and relapsing brain disease characterized by problematic drug or alcohol use that leads to clinically significant impairment or distress. It is treatable using a combination of medications, therapy, and support groups, and early intervention can improve outcomes and reduce the risk of long-term health problems associated with substance dependence.",2,True

","Drug dependence, also known as substance dependence, is a condition in which an individual has developed a compulsive need for a particular drug or medication. This can lead to problems with work, school, and other aspects of daily life. Drug dependence typically develops over time, as the individual becomes accustomed to the effects of the drug and may experience withdrawal symptoms when the drug is not taken. There are various types of drug dependence, including physical dependence (addiction) and psychological dependence. Physical dependence occurs when the body adapts to the presence of a particular substance, leading to a range of unpleasant physical and psychological symptoms when the substance is discontinued. Psychological dependence can occur without any physical dependence and is characterized by strong cravings for the drug and an inability to function normally without it. Drug dependence can be treated using various methods, including medication, counseling, and support groups. It is important to seek help if you or someone you know is struggling with drug dependence.",2,True
