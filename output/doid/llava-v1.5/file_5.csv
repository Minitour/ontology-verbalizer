Psoriasis 2 has a strong genetic component, with research suggesting that individuals who inherit a specific combination of genes are more likely to develop the condition. One such gene is CARD14, which is located on chromosome 17q25.

","Peroxisome biogenesis disorder 1a, also known as Zellweger syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to produce peroxisomes. These small organelles are essential for various metabolic processes, particularly in the liver and kidney.

Peroxisome biogenesis disorder 1a occurs due to mutations in the PEX1 gene, which is located on chromosome 7q21. When an individual has two copies of the faulty gene (homozygous) or a combination of one faulty gene and one working gene (compound heterozygous), it can lead to the development of this disorder.

The symptoms of peroxisome biogenesis disorder 1a are varied, depending on which organs are affected.

","Peroxisome biogenesis disorder 2a, also known as Zellweger Syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to produce peroxisomes. Peroxisomes are small organelles found in all cells that play a vital role in breaking down fats and other lipids. When these organelles are not functioning properly, it can lead to a build-up of fatty substances in the liver, spleen, kidneys, and brain. This can cause severe developmental delays, physical abnormalities, and even death if left untreated.
Peroxisome biogenesis disorder 2a is caused by mutations in the PEX5 gene on chromosome 12p13. With homozygous mutation of this gene, the body cannot produce enough functional peroxisomes and as a result, the accumulation of fatty substances occurs. This disorder can affect multiple organ systems including the liver, spleen, kidneys, lungs, and brain.
Treatment for Peroxisome Biogenesis Disorder 2a typically involves enzyme replacement therapy using large quantities of the missing enzyme. In addition, dietary modifications may also be necessary to help manage symptoms related to fatty substance build-up in organs and tissues.
Overall, Peroxisome Biogenesis Disorder 2a is a complex and life-threatening condition that requires comprehensive management strategies to support the affected individual's health and well-being.",3,True

This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called starch branching enzyme I, which is involved in the modification process. When the STT3A gene does not work correctly due to a mutation, this leads to problems with glycosylation, which can cause a range of symptoms and health issues.

People with CDG IW may experience developmental delay, intellectual disability, failure to thrive (difficulty gaining weight and growing at a normal rate), hypotonia (low muscle tone), and seizures. The severity of symptoms can vary widely among affected individuals and can change over time.

","Hyper IgE Recurrent Infection Syndrome 2 (HIRES2) is a type of autosomal recessive disease, which means that it is inherited from one's parents when both of them have the necessary gene mutation. This condition is part of a larger group of disorders known as hyper IgE syndromes, characterized by high levels of IgE antibodies in the blood.

In HIRES2, the excessive production and activation of mast cells are particularly pronounced. Mast cells are a type of white blood cell that play an important role in protecting the body against parasites and foreign substances. However, when there is too much IgE present in the system, these mast cells can become overactive, leading to chronic inflammation, recurrent infections, and tissue damage.

The DOCK8 gene, located on chromosome 9p24, has been identified as a key contributor to HIRES2. Mutations in this gene can lead to the dysfunction or complete loss of an important protein involved in regulating mast cell activation. As a result, excessive IgE production and the subsequent inflammation that comes with it are more likely to occur, ultimately leading to the characteristic symptoms of HIRES2.

In summary, Hyper IgE Recurrent Infection Syndrome 2 (HIRES2) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by high levels of IgE antibodies and chronic inflammation caused by dysfunctional mast cells. This condition is linked to mutations in the DOCK8 gene on chromosome 9p24, which affects the regulation of mast cell activation.",4,True

","Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a group of genetic disorders that affect the body's connective tissues, which are responsible for providing strength and elasticity to various tissues in our bodies. EDS can lead to joint problems such as hypermobility, chronic pain, and increased risk of injury. The symptoms of EDS can vary greatly between individuals, and some people may not experience any symptoms at all.
EDS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, which means that a person must inherit the faulty gene from just one parent to develop the condition. There are several types of EDS, each with its own unique set of symptoms. EDS-Arthrochalasia (type 2) is one such type, characterized by joint hypermobility, recurrent dislocations, and chronic pain in the joints.
EHS-Arthrochalasia (type 2) has a material basis in heterozygous mutation in the COL1A2 gene on chromosome 7q21. It is important to note that while genetic testing can help diagnose EDS, it should only be done by qualified professionals and in accordance with established guidelines to ensure accuracy and patient privacy.
Overall, EDS is a complex condition that requires ongoing management and support from healthcare professionals to address the various symptoms and complications associated with this disorder.",4,True

EDS type 3, also known as hypermobile EDS, is characterized by extreme joint mobility, skin that is easily stretched, and a predisposition to developing anxiety or depression. People with this type of EDS may also have other physical symptoms such as chronic pain, fatigue, and organ dysfunction.

Collagen is a protein found in connective tissue, which gives structure to skin, bones, muscles, and other body structures. When there is a mutation in a gene that provides instructions for making collagen, it can cause the collagen to be unstable or defective, leading to weakness or instability in connective tissues.

Symptoms of polymyositis may include muscle weakness, pain, and fatigue. Diagnosis typically involves a combination of medical history, physical examination, blood tests, and imaging studies. Treatment options for polymyositis may vary depending on the severity of the condition and individual circumstances; however, common treatment approaches may include medications to reduce inflammation and improve muscle function, physical therapy to help restore strength and flexibility, and supportive care to manage symptoms and address any associated complications.",5,True

The acronym ""TORCH"" stands for Toxoplasmosis, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Herpes Simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). These infections can cause a variety of problems for the developing fetus if they occur during pregnancy.

Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by the Toxoplasma gondii parasite, which can be passed from a mother to her baby through her placenta or breast milk. It can cause problems with the brain and eyes, as well as other organ damage.

Rubella, also known as German measles, is caused by the Rubella virus and can also be passed from a pregnant woman to her baby. It can cause problems with the developing fetus's ears, eyes, heart, and brain.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a member of the family of viruses known as the member of the family of viruses known as the ""Lyssaviridae"" or ""mengleukocytic virus"", which also includes the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and the Nairovirus. It is primarily spread through saliva, urine, and respiratory droplets, and can cause a variety of problems for the developing fetus if it occurs during pregnancy.

Herpes Simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is a member of the family of viruses known as the ""Viralia"", which also includes the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated virus (KSHV). It can cause cold sores, and it can be passed from a pregnant woman to her baby during delivery or through breastfeeding.

In contrast, other forms of POI are inherited in a recessive pattern or are due to spontaneous mutations. These patterns require the presence of two copies of the gene with the mutation for an individual to be at risk of developing the condition.

It's important to note that not all cases of POI have a known genetic cause. In some instances, environmental factors or other unknown causes may contribute to the development of the condition.

","An anaplastic oligodendroglioma is a type of brain tumor that arises from the cells in the brain that produce myelin, which insulates nerve cells. Oligodendrogliomas are classified based on their appearance and molecular characteristics, such as IDH gene mutations and chromosomal deletions.
An anaplastic oligodendroglioma is a more aggressive type of tumor that has undergone significant cellular changes compared to a typical oligodendroglioma. Anaplastic oligodendrogliomas have a higher risk of recurrence and are more likely to be fatal than other types of oligodendrogliomas.
An IDH gene mutation is one of the key molecular characteristics of anaplastic oligodendroglioma. This mutation leads to the production of an abnormal protein that can promote tumor growth and make the cancer more aggressive. Additionally, anaplastic oligodendrogliomas often have losses of chromosomes 1p and 19q, which are known as the ""1p/19q codeletion."" This genetic alteration is also associated with a higher risk of recurrence and poorer survival.
Therefore, an IDH-mutant and 1p/19q-codeleted oligodendroglioma is a subtype of anaplastic oligodendroglioma that has both the IDH gene mutation and the ""1p/19q codeletion."" This subtype is known for its aggressive behavior and poor prognosis.",4,True

","Lipofibromatosis, also known as Schwannomas, is a type of connective tissue cancer. It originates from the sheath surrounding peripheral nerves and has a characteristic appearance with mature adipose tissue and fibrous septae. The genesis of lipofibromatosis involves a mutation in the LMNA gene that leads to an increased production of lipid droplets, causing cell proliferation and tumor formation.

Lipofibromatosis may occur spontaneously or as a result of acquired mutations from various sources such as environmental exposures or inherited genetic factors. The clinical presentation of lipofibromatosis varies depending on the location, size, and number of lesions. Symptoms can include pain, numbness, weakness, or limited mobility due to pressure on the nerve roots.

Diagnosis typically involves imaging techniques such as MRI or CT scans to identify the presence and extent of the tumor. A biopsy may also be performed to confirm the diagnosis and assess the histological features of the lipofibromatosis. Treatment options for lipofibromatosis include surgical excision, radiotherapy, or a combination of both, depending on the size, location, and risk factors associated with the tumor.
