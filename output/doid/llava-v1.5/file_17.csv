","Mood disorder, also known as affective disorder, is a category of mental health conditions that are characterized by significant disturbances in mood or emotions. These disturbances may include feelings of sadness, happiness, fear, or anxiety, and can interfere with an individual's ability to function in daily life. Mood disorders can be further classified into several subcategories, including major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, dysthymia, and cyclothymia. It is important to note that mood disorders are different from personality disorders, which involve enduring patterns of abnormal behavior and thinking. If you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of a mood disorder, it is recommended to seek help from a mental health professional.",3,True

","Purpura is a type of hemorrhagic disease that affects the skin and mucous membranes. It is characterized by the formation of purple or reddish-purple discoloration on the skin, which is caused by the breakdown of red blood cells. Purpura can be classified into several types based on its cause and severity.
One type of purpura is called purpuric disorder, which is characterized by the formation of large, tender, and painful hemorrhoids in the rectum and other parts of the digestive tract. This condition can be caused by a variety of factors, including infections, inflammation, and certain medications.
Another type of purpura is called MESH:D011693, which is characterized by the presence of large numbers of tiny blood vessels in the skin and mucous membranes. This condition can be caused by a variety of factors, including autoimmune disorders, infections, and certain medications.
Overall, purpura is a serious medical condition that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent complications such as infection and sepsis. It is important for individuals with purpura to seek medical attention from a qualified healthcare provider who can determine the cause and develop an appropriate treatment plan.",3,True

","Pancreatic signet ring cell adenocarcinoma is a type of pancreatic cancer that features distinctive cells with a characteristic appearance. These cells are characterized by their round, clear cytoplasm and the presence of a single, prominent, large, dark-staining nucleus.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common type of pancreatic cancer, accounting for approximately 85% of all cases. However, signet ring cell carcinoma of the pancreas is a distinct subtype that makes up only about 1-2% of all pancreatic cancers.

Signet ring cell carcinoma of the pancreas shares some similarities with other adenocarcinomas in terms of its histology, but it has unique features that set it apart from other types of pancreatic cancer. As a result, this subtype tends to have different treatment approaches than standard PDAC.

If you have been diagnosed with pancreatic signet ring cell adenocarcinoma, it is important to work closely with your healthcare team to develop an individualized treatment plan that takes into account the unique features of your specific cancer subtype.",3,True

Liver cancer is characterized by the abnormal growth of liver cells that form a tumor. The location of the tumor can vary; it may be located within the liver (intrahepatic), outside the liver in the area surrounding the bile ducts (extrahepatic), or even in the lining of the abdominal cavity (peritoneal).

Treatment options for liver cancer depend on various factors such as the stage of the tumor, patient's overall health, and the presence of any underlying conditions that may be contributing to the cancer. Treatment options may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapies.

","Empty sella syndrome (ESS) is a type of pituitary gland disease in which the normal pituitary gland is replaced by a non-functioning or partially functioning pituitary gland. The condition is characterized by the presence of a small, empty sella turcica (a natural depression in the sphenoid bone that houses the pituitary gland).
ESS can be caused by various factors such as tumors, hemorrhage, trauma, or infection. It may also occur due to genetic factors or certain medications. Symptoms of ESS include decreased hormone production, which can lead to a variety of physical and mental health issues. Treatment options depend on the underlying cause but may include medication, surgery, or radiation therapy.
In summary, empty sella syndrome is a pituitary gland disorder characterized by the presence of a small, non-functioning or partially functioning pituitary gland in the absence of the normal pituitary gland. It can be caused by various factors and may cause decreased hormone production and related symptoms.",2,True

It can be classified as a type of supratentorial cancer, which occurs above the tentorium cerebelli, a structure that separates the cerebrum from the brainstem. Hypothalamic neoplasm is also considered a type of hypothalamic disease since it involves abnormal cell growth in this region of the brain.

The terms ""neoplasm"" and ""tumor"" are often used interchangeably to refer to abnormal growths of cells, including those that can be benign or malignant (cancerous). In the case of hypothalamic neoplasm, it refers specifically to an abnormal growth in the hypothalamus, which is a part of the brain responsible for regulating various functions such as appetite, body temperature, and hormone production.

It's important to note that not all tumors are cancerous, and benign tumors can still cause problems if they grow large enough or press on surrounding structures in the brain. In general, the treatment of hypothalamic neoplasm depends on the type and location of the tumor, as well as the patient's overall health and symptoms.",5,True

","Crigler-Najjar syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the metabolism of bilirubin, a yellowish pigment found in blood and bile. It occurs when there is a deficiency or lack of the enzyme UDP glucuronyl transferase (UGT), which is responsible for converting bilirubin into a form that can be excreted by the liver. As a result, bilirubin builds up in the blood and causes jaundice, which gives the skin and eyes a yellowish tint.

An apocrine adenoma is typically small in size, ranging from a few millimeters to a few centimeters in diameter. It may be solitary or multiple in number, and can occur at any age but is more commonly seen during middle-age.

Although apocrine adenomas are not cancerous, they can cause problems if they become large enough to obstruct the flow of sweat through the nearby hair follicles. This can lead to symptoms such as itching, irritation, and even infection. Additionally, some people may experience changes in their sense of smell or taste due to the presence of these tumors.

If an apocrine adenoma is causing problems, it can be removed through a procedure called excision. This involves cutting out the tumor and surrounding tissue, and then closing the resulting wound with stitches. In most cases, this procedure can be done on an outpatient basis and should not cause any long-term complications.",2,True

","Liver disease is a medical condition that affects the liver, which is a vital organ located in the upper right side of the abdomen. The liver plays an essential role in several bodily functions such as digestion, metabolism, and detoxification. When the liver is not functioning correctly due to disease or injury, it can lead to various health issues.
Liver disease can be broadly classified into two main categories: infectious diseases and non-infectious diseases. Infectious diseases are caused by viruses, bacteria, or parasites that enter the body and attack the liver cells, leading to inflammation and damage to the organ. Non-infectious diseases, on the other hand, are not contagious and are caused by various factors such as genetics, environmental exposure, and lifestyle choices.
Some common types of non-infectious liver disease include cirrhosis, hepatitis, gallstones, and fatty liver disease. Cirrhosis is a condition where the liver becomes permanently damaged due to long-term alcohol abuse or other causes such as viral infections, medications, or autoimmune diseases. Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver caused by various factors such as viruses, bacteria, and medications. Gallstones are small stones that form in the gallbladder and can block the bile ducts, causing pain and other symptoms. Fatty liver disease occurs when too much fat accumulates in the liver cells, leading to inflammation and damage over time.
Treatment options for liver disease depend on the underlying cause and severity of the condition. In some cases, lifestyle changes such as weight loss, avoiding alcohol, and following a healthy diet can help manage symptoms and improve liver function. Medications may also be prescribed to treat specific conditions or complications related to liver disease. In severe cases, surgery or liver transplantation may be necessary to replace damaged liver tissue with healthy cells.
It is important for individuals who suspect they have liver disease to seek medical attention promptly to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. Early detection and intervention can improve outcomes and potentially prevent long-term complications related to the condition.",4,True

2. Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) - this is the most common type of skin cancer and typically appears as a pearly or waxy bump on the skin's surface.
3. Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) - it usually develops in sun-exposed areas of the body, such as the face, ears, and neck, and can appear as a firm, red nodule with a scaly or crusted surface.

Early detection and treatment are crucial to prevent the spread of skin cancer and improve the chances of a successful recovery. Regular self-examination, protective measures such as sunscreen use and avoiding prolonged exposure to UV rays, and routine check-ups with a healthcare professional can help reduce the risk of developing skin cancer.",8,True

","Rh isoimmunization, also known as Rh incompatibility, occurs when a woman who has Rh-negative blood (Rh-) becomes pregnant with a baby who has Rh-positive blood (Rh+). During the pregnancy, if the mother's blood comes into contact with the baby's blood, it can cause the production of anti-D antibodies in the mother. These antibodies can cross the placenta and attack the baby's red blood cells, leading to hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN).

Rh isoimmunization can be managed through a process called Rh immune globulin (RhIG) administration. This medication contains antibodies that can neutralize any anti-D antibodies in the mother's blood, preventing them from attacking the baby's red blood cells. RhIG is usually given to the mother within 72 hours after delivery of the baby or as a prophylaxis before delivery if there is a high risk of HDN.

In addition to RhIG administration, other management strategies may include monitoring the mother and baby for signs of HDN, such as jaundice, anemia, or low blood sugar levels. If HDN does occur, it can be treated with exchange transfusion, where the baby's blood is exchanged for donor blood to replace the damaged red blood cells.

Overall, Rh isoimmunization is a serious condition that requires careful management to prevent complications in the mother and her newborn baby.",2,True

* Resonance disorders: These involve problems with the way speech sounds are produced due to issues with the vocal cords or other structures in the airway. Examples include breathy voice, a high-pitched voice, or a hoarse voice.
* Motor speech disorders: These disorders affect the muscles used for speaking and can cause difficulties with articulating sounds accurately. Examples include stuttering (repetition of sounds or words) and cluttering (speech that is difficult to understand due to excessive speech sound errors).
* Phonological processes: These are patterns of speech sound errors that occur across different sounds in a language. Examples include final consonant deletion (e.g., ""bank"" becomes ""bang"") and initial sound substitution (e.g., ""house"" becomes ""hice"").
