CES can cause a range of symptoms, including lower back pain, loss of bladder and bowel control, numbness in the groin and perianal areas, and weakness in the legs. It is essential for individuals experiencing these symptoms to seek immediate medical attention, as CES can lead to permanent neurological damage if left untreated.

Diagnosis of CES typically involves a combination of physical examination, imaging studies such as MRI or CT scans, and sometimes electromyography (EMG) to evaluate muscle function. Treatment for CES depends on the underlying cause but may involve surgery, medications, or physical therapy to help manage symptoms and improve function.

","Hypotrichosis of the eyelid is a condition characterized by an abnormal lack of hair (hairlessness) on the upper or lower eyelid. It can be congenital (present at birth) or acquired later in life, and may affect one or both eyelids. While it's not a common condition, it can cause discomfort or visual issues if left untreated.

Treatment options for hypotrichosis of the eyelid depend on the underlying cause and severity of the condition. For congenital forms, surgical intervention may be necessary to restore normal eyelid appearance and function. Acquired cases can often be treated with topical medications or laser therapy. In some cases, hair growth may be stimulated through the use of minoxidil (Rogaine) or other topical treatments.

It's important to consult an eye care professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan if you suspect that you or a loved one may have hypotrichosis of the eyelid. Early intervention can help minimize complications and ensure the best possible outcome.",3,True

","Hyperlipoproteinemia type V, also known as Fredrickson type V lipaemia or familial hyperlipoproteinemia type V, is a genetic disorder characterized by elevated levels of triglycerides in the blood. It is one of several types of familial hyperlipidemia, which are inherited disorders that result from mutations in genes responsible for regulating cholesterol and lipid metabolism.

Hyperlipoproteinemia type V is distinguished by its particular composition of lipoproteins, including the presence of large amounts of VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein) particles. These VLDL particles are responsible for delivering cholesterol to peripheral tissues, but in people with this condition, they may be overloaded and unable to perform their function properly. This can lead to an accumulation of cholesterol in the blood vessels, increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease such as atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.

Treatment for hyperlipoproteinemia type V usually involves lifestyle modifications such as a low-fat diet, regular exercise, and weight management to reduce triglyceride levels in the blood. In some cases, medications may also be prescribed to help lower cholesterol levels and manage the condition effectively. It is important for individuals with this disorder to work closely with their healthcare provider to develop an individualized treatment plan that addresses their specific needs and helps reduce the risk of related health complications.",4,True

1. Slow growth before and after birth, which can lead to short stature in adulthood.
2. Intellectual disability ranging from mild to severe, which can include speech difficulties and challenges with motor skills.
3. Distinctive facial features such as a wide-set eyes, large ears, and a thin upper lip.
4. Skeletal abnormalities involving the arms and hands, including clinodactyly (a condition where the fifth finger is bend inwards) and camptodactyly (bent thumbs).
5. Other potential health issues that can occur include heart defects, kidney problems, and seizures.
6. CdLS affects approximately 1 in every 100,000 to 200,000 newborns worldwide. It is caused by a mutation in the NSD1 gene, which is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 7. Treatment options for CdLS focus on managing the symptoms and providing support to the individual and their family.",6,True

    :has_exact_synonym ""EDMD""@en .

","Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive weakness and wasting of skeletal muscles, particularly those in the face, arms, legs, and trunk, as well as cardiac muscle. It is caused by mutations in the desmin gene, which is responsible for the production of desmin protein. This protein plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of skeletal muscle fibers.

EDMD usually presents in childhood and adolescence and can lead to severe disability if not managed properly. Treatment options may include physical therapy, medications, and assistive devices. In some cases, a wheelchair may be required for mobility. There is currently no cure for EDMD, but researchers are working on developing treatments that could slow its progression or even reverse the effects of the disease.

It's important to note that while EDMD primarily affects skeletal muscles, it can also impact cardiac muscle, leading to heart problems over time. Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider are crucial for monitoring the progression of the disease and identifying any potential complications early on.

In summary, Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive weakness and wasting of skeletal muscles, particularly those in the face, arms, legs, and trunk, as well as cardiac muscle. It is caused by mutations in the desmin gene and usually presents in childhood and adolescence. Treatment options may include physical therapy, medications, and assistive devices, but a cure is not yet available.

It typically occurs in the outer part of the uterus, which includes the uterine tubes (also known as fallopian tubes). Uterine adnexa cancer can also occur in other parts of the reproductive system, such as the ovaries or the cervix.

The exact cause of uterine adnexa cancer is not entirely understood, but it may be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Some studies suggest that certain gene mutations may increase the risk of developing this type of cancer, while others indicate that exposure to certain chemicals or hormones may also play a role.

Uterine adnexa cancer can cause a variety of symptoms, including abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, and bloating. It is often diagnosed through a combination of medical imaging tests, such as ultrasounds and CT scans, as well as biopsies to remove and examine tissue samples from the affected area.

Treatment for uterine adnexa cancer typically involves a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy. The specific treatment plan will depend on the stage and location of the cancer, as well as the patient's overall health and personal preferences. In some cases, hormone therapy may also be recommended to slow the growth of the cancer or to alleviate symptoms.

With early detection and proper treatment, uterine adnexa cancer can be effectively managed, and many women are able to achieve a long-term remission or cure. It is important for women to discuss their risk factors and symptoms with their healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for their individual case.",2,True

Malignant neoplasm of the trigone (bladder) refers to a cancerous growth in this specific area. It is one type of bladder cancer, which can be further classified into various subtypes based on the type of cells involved and their location within the bladder. Bladder cancer is usually diagnosed through a combination of imaging tests (such as CT scans or ultrasounds), biopsies, and urine cytology. Treatment options for bladder trigone cancer may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy, depending on the extent and stage of the cancer.

Malignant tumor of the trigone (bladder) refers to a benign (non-cancerous) growth in this specific area. However, it is essential to note that some benign tumors may eventually become cancerous over time if not properly monitored and treated. Regular check-ups with your healthcare provider can help detect any changes or abnormalities early on, allowing for timely intervention and prevention of potential complications.

","Neurogenic Bladder: A Type of Bladder Disease
=============================================

Neurogenic bladder, also known as neuropathic bladder or neurogenic dysfunction of the urinary bladder, is a type of bladder disease that occurs when the nerves responsible for controlling the storage and elimination of urine are affected. This can result in difficulties with urination, such as hesitancy, slow filling, intermittency or even complete loss of bladder control (incontinence).

The symptoms of neurogenic bladder can vary widely depending on the extent of nerve damage and the underlying cause. Some people may experience mild symptoms that are easily managed with lifestyle changes, while others may require more intensive treatment such as medications or surgery.

In addition to its impact on daily life, neurogenic bladder can also have broader implications for a person's health and well-being. It is important for those with this condition to work closely with their healthcare provider to develop a treatment plan tailored to their individual needs.

Overall, understanding the symptoms of neurogenic bladder and seeking proper medical care can help individuals manage this condition effectively and maintain their quality of life.",4,True

This can lead to difficulties in emptying the bladder completely and may result in symptoms such as frequent urination, urinary incontinence, discomfort or pain in the lower abdomen, and a feeling of incomplete bladder emptying.

Low compliance bladder is typically diagnosed through a combination of medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests such as uroflowmetry or post-void residual volume measurement. Treatment options for low compliance bladder may include medications to relax the bladder muscles, pelvic floor exercises to strengthen the muscles, and in some cases, surgical intervention. It is important to consult a healthcare professional for proper evaluation and treatment of this condition.",5,True

","Splenic flexure cancer, also known as colon cancer of the splenic flexure or malignant neoplasm of the splenic flexure, is a type of descending colon cancer that originates in the area where the colon bends (the splenic flexure) and spreads to other parts of the body.
It is important to note that the location of this cancer can vary depending on its stage, but it typically starts near the cecum, a pouch-like structure at the beginning of the colon, and may extend through the sigmoid colon (the area between the cecum and rectum) before spreading further.
The symptoms of splenic flexure cancer can include abdominal pain or cramping, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, and a feeling that the bowel isn't emptying completely. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional if you experience any of these symptoms, as they can also be caused by other conditions.
The diagnosis of splenic flexure cancer usually involves a combination of tests such as a physical examination, colonoscopy, and imaging studies like CT or MRI scans. Once the diagnosis is made, further testing may be done to determine the extent (stage) of the cancer.
Treatment options for splenic flexure cancer depend on the stage of the disease but may include surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy. A multidisciplinary approach involving a team of healthcare professionals is often recommended to provide the best possible care.

It is important to note that there are different types of colorectal cancer, including those that affect the rectum or other areas of the large intestine. However, sigmoid colon cancer specifically refers to cancer that develops in the sigmoid colon.

The symptoms of sigmoid colon cancer may include abdominal pain or bloating, diarrhea or constipation, and blood in the stool. These symptoms can be caused by a variety of factors and may not necessarily indicate cancer. It is important to speak with a healthcare professional if you experience any of these symptoms.

Diagnosis of sigmoid colon cancer typically involves a combination of tests, such as a physical examination, blood tests, and imaging studies like a CT or MRI scan. Treatment options for sigmoid colon cancer may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of these approaches.

Symptoms of histoplasmosis meningitis can include headache, fever, stiff neck, and a decreased ability to move the eyes. In some cases, it may also cause confusion, nausea, vomiting, and seizures. The symptoms usually develop within a few weeks after exposure to the fungus, although in some cases they may not appear for many months or even years later.
Diagnosis of histoplasmosis meningitis typically involves a combination of medical history, physical examination, blood tests, and imaging studies such as MRI or CT scan. Treatment usually involves antifungal medications, such as amphotericin B or fluconazole, given intravenously in a hospital setting. In some cases, corticosteroids may also be used to reduce inflammation and swelling in the brain.
Prevention of histoplasmosis meningitis involves avoiding exposure to soil contaminated with Histoplasma capsulatum fungus, as well as practicing good hygiene and wearing protective gear when working outdoors in areas where this fungus is common. Additionally, people with weakened immune systems or pre-existing conditions such as cancer or HIV may be at higher risk for developing histoplasmosis meningitis and should take extra precautions to avoid exposure.",2,True

The term ""luxation"" refers to the displacement or separation of a bodily structure from its normal position. In this case, it's the globe (the clear, round dome covering the eye) that has been displaced or separated from its normal position within the eye socket.

Luxation of the globe can occur due to various reasons such as trauma, inflammation, or certain medical conditions. Symptoms may include pain, redness, swelling, and limited mobility of the affected eye. Treatment usually involves realigning the displaced globe back into its proper position, followed by appropriate care and monitoring to ensure a full recovery.

It's important to note that while luxation of the globe is indeed related to an injury or disease of the eye, the term ""luxation of eye"" could be confusing as it may suggest that the entire eyeball has been displaced from its socket. However, in reality, only the globe (the clear dome covering the eye) is affected and not the entire eyeball.",2,True

","olecranon bursitis is a medical condition that affects the olecranon, which is the pointy end of the elbow. It is caused by inflammation of the bursa, a small sac filled with fluid that helps to cushion and lubricate the joint. This inflammation can cause pain, swelling, and stiffness in the affected area.
olecranon bursitis is often caused by repetitive overhead motion or prolonged pressure on the elbow. It can also be caused by a fall or a blow to the elbow. In some cases, it may be associated with other medical conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or gout. Treatment for olecranon bursitis usually involves resting the affected area, applying ice to reduce swelling, and taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to relieve pain and inflammation. In more severe cases, corticosteroid injections may be necessary. Physical therapy may also be recommended to help improve range of motion and strengthen the muscles around the elbow.",10,True

Potter syndrome can lead to serious health complications for newborn infants, including respiratory distress, poor feeding, low blood sugar levels, and high blood pressure. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial in managing the symptoms and ensuring the best possible outcome for affected infants. Treatment may involve providing supplemental oxygen, managing fluid levels, and addressing any electrolyte imbalances that may arise. In some cases, dialysis or kidney transplantation may be necessary to support the affected infant's renal function.

It is important for healthcare providers to be aware of Potter syndrome as a potential complication during pregnancy and delivery, especially in cases where there are risk factors such as low amniotic fluid volume or a history of renal agenesis.

","Ocular motility disease, also known as ocular motor dysfunction or disorder of eye movements, is a condition characterized by abnormal or disturbed movement of the eyes. It can affect various aspects of eye movement, including tracking, alignment, and focusing. Ocular motility diseases are often classified according to which part of the eye is affected, such as the muscles that control eye movement (cranial nerves), the visual pathways in the brain, or both.

Some common ocular motility disorders include:

1. Nystagmus: Involuntary, repetitive back-and-forth eye movements known as jerks or oscillations.
2. Strabismus: Misalignment of the eyes, which can occur in various forms such as esotropia (crossed eyes), exotropia (wandering eyes), and hypotropia (downward deviation).
3. Blepharospasm: Involuntary closing or twitching of the eyelids, often accompanied by facial spasms.
4. Ptosis: A condition where the upper eyelid droops or falls, affecting vision.
5. Ocular migraine: Short-lived visual disturbances that can cause blind spots, zigzag lines, or flashes of light in one eye.

Ocular motility diseases can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and neurological conditions. Treatment options may vary depending on the specific disorder and its underlying cause but can include medications, botulinum toxin injections, surgery, or vision therapy. Regular eye exams are crucial for early detection and management of ocular motility diseases to prevent complications such as double vision, amblyopia (lazy eye), or permanent visual impairment.<|end_of_quote|>",5,True
