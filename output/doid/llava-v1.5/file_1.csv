It's worth noting that this type of intellectual disability does not have any specific set of symptoms or features, unlike syndromic intellectual disabilities, which are associated with certain physical and developmental abnormalities. However, it may still impact various aspects of a person's life, including their cognitive function, motor skills, and social interactions.
It is important to note that non-syndromic X-linked intellectual disability can have varying degrees of severity, ranging from mild to severe.

","Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of genetic disorders that affect the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are small endocrine glands located on top of each kidney. They produce various hormones, such as cortisol and aldosterone, which help regulate bodily functions like blood pressure, heart rate, and immune response.

CAH occurs when the enzymes responsible for producing these hormones are missing or do not work properly. As a result, the adrenal glands produce too much or too little of these hormones, leading to a range of health problems. The severity of symptoms varies depending on the type of CAH and which enzyme is affected.

There are two main types of CAH: salt-wasting (due to deficiency in 21-hydroxylase) and glucocorticoid-remediable (due to deficiency in 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase). Salt-wasting CAH causes the body to excrete too much sodium, leading to low blood pressure and other complications. In contrast, glucocorticoid-remediable CAH can be treated with a steroid medication that replaces the missing hormones, allowing the body to function normally.

It's important for individuals with CAH to work closely with their healthcare providers to manage their symptoms and ensure proper treatment. This may include regular monitoring of blood pressure, hormone levels, and other bodily functions. With proper care and management, people with CAH can lead a relatively normal life.",7,True

","Charge syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects many parts of the body, including the face, ears, eyes, heart, inner ear, and retina. It is caused by mutations in the CHRFA2 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called chromodomain-helicase-binding protein A. This protein is involved in several important processes in the cell, such as DNA repair and regulation of gene expression.

People with Charge syndrome may have a combination of physical and developmental problems, including:

* Hearing and vision impairments
* Facial abnormalities, such as small or absent ears, cleft lip and palate, and low-set eyes
* Heart defects
* Ear infections and other health issues
* Delayed growth and development

Charge syndrome can also affect a person's behavior and cognitive function. Some individuals with the disorder may have autism spectrum disorder or other developmental delays. Early intervention and specialized care can help manage the symptoms and improve quality of life for people with Charge syndrome.",4,True

MSS can lead to a range of health problems, including severe respiratory issues due to underdeveloped airways and poor lung function. This can make breathing difficult, especially during exercise or in cold weather. Additionally, the dysmorphic facial features associated with MSS may cause problems such as speech difficulties, hearing loss, and dental issues.

In terms of mental retardation, the severity of this condition varies widely between affected individuals. Some people with MSS may have mild cognitive impairments, while others may experience more significant intellectual disabilities. Despite these challenges, many individuals with MSS lead fulfilling lives and benefit from specialized care, supportive families, and dedicated healthcare professionals.

","Adrenal gland pheochromocytoma is a type of malignant tumor that develops in the adrenal gland, which is responsible for producing hormones such as epinephrine and norepinephrine. These hormones play a crucial role in regulating various bodily functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, and metabolism.

Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor that typically affects adults between the ages of 20 and 50 years old. It can be spontaneously occurring or hereditary, with certain genetic mutations increasing the risk of developing this type of tumor.

Symptoms of adrenal gland pheochromocytoma may include high blood pressure (hypertension), palpitations, sweating, headaches, and anxiety. These symptoms are caused by the excessive production of epinephrine and norepinephrine. In some cases, a tumor can cause both sides of the adrenal gland to be enlarged or tender, which may be felt as a mass or lump in the abdomen.

Diagnosis typically involves blood tests to measure hormone levels, an imaging scan to visualize the adrenal gland and detect any tumors, and a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment for pheochromocytoma may involve surgical removal of the tumor or medications to reduce excessive hormone production.

In summary, Adrenal gland pheochromocytoma is a rare type of malignant tumor that affects the adrenal gland and causes overproduction of adrenaline, leading to various symptoms such as high blood pressure, palpitations, sweating and anxiety.

SCA14 is an autosomal dominant disorder which means that a mutation in only one copy of the gene can be passed on to offspring, increasing their risk of developing the condition. The PRKCG gene, specifically its product, has been implicated in the development and progression of this type of ataxia.
Symptoms typically begin during adolescence or early adulthood and may include:
1. Ataxia - loss of balance and coordination
2. Dysarthria - slurred speech due to difficulty with muscle control
3. Dysphagia - difficulty swallowing
4. Changes in gait, such as a wide-based stance or scanning movements
5. Nystagmus (involuntary eye movement)
6. Progressive decline of fine motor skills and dexterity
7. Reduced reflexes
8. Coordination problems with upper extremities
9. Visual changes, such as loss of visual acuity or color vision (in advanced cases)
10. Progression of symptoms can vary among individuals; in some cases, it may be relatively slow and mild, while others may experience a more rapid progression leading to significant disability.
There is no cure for SCA14 at this time, but medications and therapies can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.",2,True

","Spinocerebellar ataxia type 18, also known as Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive loss of coordination and balance. It is one of the most common forms of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, which means it can be inherited from either parent and tends to affect multiple family members.

Machado-Joseph disease is caused by a mutation in the ATXN18 gene, located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 7 at positions 22-23. The mutated gene provides instructions for making a protein called ""ATXN18,"" which is involved in the function of cilia, tiny hair-like structures that help regulate movement within cells and throughout the body.

As the disease progresses, individuals with MJD may experience difficulty with fine motor skills, such as buttoning their clothes or typing; gait disturbances, including a wide gait and poor balance; speech difficulties; and coordination problems. In some cases, the disease can also affect cognitive function and cause dementia-like symptoms.

There is currently no cure for Machado-Joseph disease, but treatments are available to help manage the symptoms. Medications, such as antivirals and antibiotics, may be used to address infections or other issues related to the disease. Physical therapy and occupational therapy can also be helpful in maintaining muscle strength and coordination.

In summary, spinocerebellar ataxia type 18, or Machado-Joseph disease, is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive loss of coordination and balance. It is caused by a mutation in the ATXN18 gene and can affect both children and adults. While there is no cure for the disease, treatments are available to help manage its symptoms.",2,True

In some cases, surgery may be necessary to relieve pressure on affected nerves or to remove damaged tissue.

It is important for individuals with autoimmune diseases of the central nervous system to work closely with their healthcare providers to develop a comprehensive treatment plan that addresses their specific needs and symptoms.

The lymphatic system is part of the immune system and is responsible for producing white blood cells called lymphocytes, which help fight infections and diseases. Lymphoma occurs when these lymphocytes grow abnormally and do not die when they should, leading to an overproduction of abnormal cells. This can cause the lymphatic system to become swollen and may also affect other parts of the body. There are several types of lymphoma, including Hodgkin's lymphoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which can be classified based on the type of cells involved and the extent of the cancer.

","Estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer (ER+ breast cancer) is a type of breast cancer that depends on the hormone estrogen for its growth and development. In ER+ breast cancer, the cancer cells have estrogen receptors on their surface or within them, which allows them to respond to the effects of estrogen.

Estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers are more common in postmenopausal women compared to premenopausal women. This type of breast cancer tends to grow slower and has a better prognosis than other types of breast cancer, such as TNBC or HER2+ breast cancer.

Treatment for ER+ breast cancer typically includes hormone therapy (such as tamoxifen or raloxifene) to block the effects of estrogen on the tumor and/or other chemotherapy drugs to kill the cancer cells. In some cases, surgery may also be necessary to remove the tumor.

","Uterine benign neoplasm is a type of female reproductive organ benign neoplasm that is located in the uterus. It can also be referred to as a uterine disease or simply a benign growth in the uterus. The term ""neoplasm"" refers to an abnormal growth of cells, which can include tumors, cysts, and other types of abnormal tissue formation. In the case of uterine benign neoplasm, the growth is located in the uterus and is typically noncancerous, meaning it does not have the potential to spread to other parts of the body or cause cancer. However, it can still cause symptoms such as abnormal bleeding, pelvic pain, and a feeling of fullness in the lower abdomen. It is important for women to receive proper medical care if they suspect they may have uterine benign neoplasm, as treatment options are available to manage their symptoms and prevent the growth from causing any further complications.",4,True

","Pharyngeal cancer, also known as pharynx cancer or throat cancer, is a type of gastrointestinal system cancer that occurs in the pharynx. The pharynx is a part of the upper respiratory tract and extends from the nasopharynx to the esophagus. Pharyngeal cancer can be classified into several types based on its location, including:

1. Glottis: The area between the vocal cords in the larynx is called the glottis.
2. Supraglottis: This refers to the area above the glottis and includes the epiglottis, which is a flap of tissue that covers the entrance to the trachea.
3. Infrahyoid: The area below the level of the sternum and between the two ribs on either side of the body is called the infrahyoid.
4. Interhyoid: This refers to the area between the hyoid bone, which is a U-shaped bone in the front of the neck, and the clavicle.
5. Submandibular: The area below the angle of the mandible (jawbone) and above the sublingual gland is called the submandibular region.
6. Jugulum: This refers to the area behind the sternocleidomastoid muscle, near the carotid canal.
7. Laryngeal: The larynx or voice box is a part of the pharynx that produces sound when air passes through it.
8. Oropharyngeal: This refers to the area behind the mouth and includes the tongue, soft palate (velum), tonsils, and other structures in the throat.
9. Hypopharyngeal: The area below the softer part of the larynx is called the hypopharynx.
10. Cervical: This refers to the neck region above the trachea.

Pharyngeal cancer can be caused by various factors, including smoking, alcohol consumption, exposure to chemicals and pollutants, a diet low in fruits and vegetables, and certain viruses such as the human papillomavirus (HPV). Early detection and treatment are crucial for successfully managing this type of cancer. If you suspect that you may have pharyngeal cancer or if you have any risk factors, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional to discuss your concerns and receive appropriate evaluation and care.",6,True

","Yes, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) metabolism disorder is a specific type of amino acid metabolic disorder. GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in regulating brain function and modulating the nervous system, and it is synthesized from glutamate through two enzymatic steps: glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) converts glutamate to GABA. In individuals with GABA metabolism disorder, there is impairment in one or both of these enzyme steps, leading to a deficiency in GABA synthesis and an imbalance in the nervous system.
GABA metabolism disorder can present with various symptoms, including anxiety, agitation, tremors, seizures, and sleep disturbances, depending on the severity of the enzyme impairment and the amount of GABA available in the brain. It is important to consult a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.",2,True

","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, leading to muscle weakness and atrophy. There are two main types of ALS: familial and sporadic. Familial ALS is inherited from one or both parents and accounts for about 10% of all cases, while sporadic ALS occurs in people with no known family history and makes up the remaining 90% of cases.

ALS is characterized by the degeneration of motor neurons, which are responsible for controlling voluntary muscles. As these neurons die, the muscles they control become weak and can eventually stop working altogether. This leads to a range of symptoms including muscle stiffness, twitching, weakness, and atrophy.

There is no cure for ALS, but there are treatments available to help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. These may include medications to alleviate muscle stiffness and spasm, as well as respiratory support to help with breathing as the disease progresses.

It's important to note that ALS is a complex condition, and researchers are still working to understand its underlying causes and develop effective treatments.

","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. It is also known as motor neuron disease. There are several types of ALS, including:

1. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Type 5 (ALS5) - This type is caused by a mutation in the SPG11 gene on chromosome 15q21.
2. Familial ALS - This type is inherited and occurs when there are genetic changes passed down through generations of a family.
3. Sporadic ALS - This type has no known genetic cause, and it occurs randomly without any family history.
4. Progressive Muscular Atrophy (PMA) - This type affects the upper motor neurons that control voluntary muscles in the arms, legs, and face.
5. Primary Lateral Sclerosis (PLS) - This type primarily affects the spinal cord and does not involve the brain or upper motor neurons.
6. Dentatorotubular Neuropathy (DRN) - This type affects the cranial nerves that control movement of muscles in the face, head, and neck.
7. ALS/Parkinsonism-Dementia Complex (ALS-PD) - This type combines features of both ALS and Parkinson's disease with cognitive decline.",4,True

","3MC syndrome, also known as 3M syndrome or Trichor-Oculodental-Skeletal (TOS) syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by several distinctive features. These features include blepharophimosis (narrowed eyelashes), blepharoptosis (droopy eyelids), hypertelorism (widely spaced eyes), cleft lip and palate, postnatal growth deficiency, cognitive impairment, hearing loss, and in some cases, additional physical abnormalities such as craniosynostosis (premature fusion of skull bones), radioulnar synostosis (fusion of the radius and ulna bones in the forearm), genital and vesicorenal anomalies.
3MC syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means that it is passed down through families when both parents pass on the gene for the condition. It occurs due to mutations in the FOXF1 gene, which is responsible for regulating the development of various body structures, including the face, eyes and internal organs.
The syndrome was first described by French pediatrician Pierre Denise Malpuech in 1957, and later renamed after other researchers contributed to its understanding over time. It can be diagnosed through a combination of medical history, physical examination, imaging studies, and genetic testing. Treatment typically focuses on managing the individual's symptoms and may include surgery for cleft lip and palate repair, eyelid surgery, and other corrective procedures as needed.",7,True

The FGFR3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called fibroblast growth factor receptor 3, which plays a role in bone and cartilage development. When this protein is not functioning properly due to a mutation, it can lead to the abnormal development of bones, cartilage, and other tissues in the body.

Van Maldergem Syndrome typically presents with a combination of facial abnormalities such as telecanthus (excessive vertical width between the eyebrows), epicanthal folds (inward rolling of the skin at the inner corners of the eyes), broad, flat facies, a wide and short nose, a large, inverted ""W""-shaped mouth, and malformed ears. Patients may also experience various skeletal abnormalities such as camptodactyly (bent thumbs), clinodactyly (bent fingers), syndactyly (webbing between the toes), and joint hyperlaxity (loose joints).
