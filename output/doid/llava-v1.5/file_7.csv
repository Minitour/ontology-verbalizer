","Paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia 1 (PNKD) is a type of autosomal dominant disease that affects the muscles. It is characterized by sudden and severe attacks of dystonic or choreathetotic movements, which are precipitated by stress, fatigue, alcohol consumption, menstruation, or caffeine intake. These movements can be very debilitating and cause significant discomfort for those affected by the disease.

PNKD is caused by mutations in the PNKD metallo-beta-lactamase domain containing gene, which is located on chromosome 2q35. The inheritance of this condition is autosomal dominant, meaning that if one parent has the gene, there is a 50% chance that their child will inherit it.

There is no cure for PNKD, but medications and other therapies can be used to manage its symptoms. It is important for those affected by this condition to work with their healthcare providers to develop an individualized treatment plan that addresses their specific needs and helps them maintain the best possible quality of life.",5,True

","Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism 18, also known as Kallmann syndrome or isolated gonadotropin deficiency, is a genetic disorder that affects the development of reproductive organs and secondary sex characteristics. It can be inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner.

Kallmann syndrome is characterized by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which means that the pituitary gland does not produce enough gonadotropins, such as luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). This leads to a decrease in testicular production of testosterone and estradiol, resulting in the absence or delay of puberty.

In some cases, anosmia, or a lack of sense of smell, may also be present in individuals with Kallmann syndrome. The genetic cause of this disorder is due to mutations in the interleukin-17 receptor D (IL17RD) gene on chromosome 3p14.

Overall, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism 18 is a rare condition that can have significant impacts on an individual's growth, development, and reproductive health. However, with proper medical care and support, those affected can lead fulfilling lives.",6,True

","Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common eye condition that affects the macula, which is responsible for sharp central vision. There are two main types of AMD: dry (atrophic) and wet (neovascular or exudative). Dry AMD occurs when the macula becomes thinner and less able to support blood vessels, causing it to dry out and die. Wet AMD is more severe and occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow under the retina, leaking blood and fluid that can cause rapid vision loss.

AMD typically affects people over 60 years of age and is more common in Caucasians than in other ethnic groups. It is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, with genetics playing a larger role in the development of AMD than previously thought. Researchers have identified several genes associated with an increased risk of developing AMD, including complement factor H (CFH), age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (APOE), and complement component 3 (C3).

","Age-related macular degeneration 5 (AMD5) is a type of age-related macular degeneration. It is characterized by the presence of drusen, which are small deposits of protein and lipid in the macula of the eye. AMD5 is caused by a mutation in the ERCC6 gene, which is located on chromosome 10q11. The condition has been referred to as ARMD5 due to its association with this specific genetic mutation. It is important to note that while AMD5 may be inherited through family history or genealogy, it does not mean that everyone who inherits the gene will develop the condition. Other factors such as age, lifestyle habits, and overall health also play a role in the development of age-related macular degeneration.",3,True

","Alzheimer's disease is a neurological disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. It is the most common cause of dementia in older adults. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the buildup of abnormal protein deposits in the brain, which leads to the death of brain cells and shrinkage of brain tissue. There are three main types of Alzheimer's disease: early-onset, late-onset, and familial. Early-onset Alzheimer's disease typically affects people under 65 years of age, while late-onset Alzheimer's disease usually begins after the age of 65. Familial Alzheimer's disease is caused by specific gene mutations that are passed down through families. In addition to protein deposits, there is evidence to suggest that inflammation and changes in metabolism also play a role in the progression of the disease. Treatments for Alzheimer's disease focus on managing symptoms and improving quality of life. There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease at this time, but ongoing research is exploring potential treatments and therapies that may help slow its progression or even reverse the damage in some cases.",8,True

","Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia 1 (ARVD1) is a type of cardiomyopathy that affects the right ventricle of the heart. It is an autosomal dominant disease, which means that it can be passed down through families and tends to occur more frequently in people with a family history of the condition. The underlying genetic cause of ARVD1 has been identified as mutations in the TGFB3 gene, located on chromosome 14q24. This genetic defect leads to abnormalities in the development and function of the right ventricle, resulting in its dysfunction and potentially causing arrhythmias, heart failure, and other complications.
ARVD1 is also known by several other names, including ARVC1, Uhl anomaly, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy 1. It is important to note that these different names refer to the same condition and are used interchangeably in medical literature.",7,True

","Atrial Heart Septal Defect 7 (ASD) is a type of autosomal dominant disease. This means that it has a strong genetic component and can be passed down through generations in families. In some cases, ASD results from mutations in the NKX2-5 gene on chromosome 5q35.

ASD refers to an atrial heart septal defect, which is a type of defect that occurs when there is an abnormal opening in the septum between the two chambers of the heart. This can lead to problems with blood flow and pressure within the heart. In some cases, ASD may also be accompanied by AV conduction defects, which affect the normal functioning of the heart's electrical system.

ASD is sometimes referred to as atrial septal defect 7 (ASD-AVCD) or the atrial septal defect syndrome. It is important to note that while these terms may be used interchangeably in some contexts, they all refer to the same condition: an atrial heart septal defect with a material basis in autosomal dominant inheritance.

Overall, ASD is a relatively common congenital heart defect, and it can have significant implications for a person's health if left untreated. Thankfully, there are effective treatments available to address the condition and improve quality of life.",7,True

","Bardet-Biedl syndrome type 11, also known as BBS11, is a genetic disorder that results from mutations in the TRIM32 gene located on chromosome 9q33. It is one of the many subtypes of Bardet-Biedl syndrome, which is characterized by various physical and developmental abnormalities.
The exact cause of BBS11 is a mutation or alteration in the TRIM32 gene that disrupts its normal function, leading to the formation of characteristic features such as polydactyly (extra fingers or toes), obesity, and various other physical and developmental abnormalities.
Bardet-Biedl syndrome type 11 is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the condition. Early diagnosis and proper management can help individuals with BBS11 lead healthy lives despite their challenges.
It's important to note that while there is no cure for Bardet-Biedl syndrome type 11, advances in medical research are continually being made to better understand the condition and improve treatment options.",3,True

It is caused by mutations in the LMNA gene on chromosome 1q22, and it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This means that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent, to develop the condition.
Type 2B1 is characterized by the presence of demyelination, which is the destruction of the myelin sheath that surrounds and insulates nerve cells. This can lead to muscle weakness and atrophy, as well as sensory loss. The condition typically affects the arms, legs, feet, and hands, and it can be progressive over time. There is no cure for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2B1, but treatment may include medications to manage symptoms, physical therapy, and assistive devices such as wheelchairs or braces.",10,True

","Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease axonal type 2 (CMT2) is a genetic disorder that affects the peripheral nerves, causing muscle weakness and atrophy. There are different types of CMT2, including those that are inherited in an autosomal dominant or recessive manner.

CMT2 type 2 (also known as AR-CMT2 or CMT2T) is a specific subtype of CMT2 that is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. It is characterized by weakness in the lower extremities, including the legs and feet, as well as muscle atrophy. The condition is caused by mutations in the MME gene, which is located on chromosome 3q25.

It's important to note that Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease axonal type 2 (CMT2) can be a part of the broader spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases called demyelinating neuropathies, which affect the peripheral nerves and are characterized by the loss of myelin sheaths around nerve fibers.

Brugada syndrome type 5 is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that if one parent has the gene mutation, there's a chance that their child will inherit it. In some cases, it may also be acquired through certain medications or other environmental factors.

Symptoms of Brugada syndrome type 5 can include palpitations, chest pain, and syncope (fainting), particularly during or after physical activity. The risk of sudden death is higher in individuals with this condition compared to the general population. Therefore, it's essential for those affected to work closely with their healthcare provider to manage symptoms and reduce potential risks.

Treatment options for Brugada syndrome type 5 may include medications to control heart rhythms, such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers. In some cases, a pacemaker may be implanted to regulate the heart's rhythm. If the condition is severe, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) may also be recommended for added protection against life-threatening arrhythmias.

","Cataract 36 is a type of autosomal recessive disease that refers to a cataract that has a material basis in homozygous mutation in the TDRD7 gene on chromosome 9q22.33. The term ""autosomal recessive"" means that both copies of the gene must be inherited, one from each parent, to cause the disease. This type of inheritance is most common for genetic traits that are not located on the sex chromosomes (X and Y).

A cataract is a clouding of the natural lens in the eye that can impair vision. Cataract 36 specifically refers to a congenital cataract, which means it is present at birth or develops early in life. The term ""congenital"" refers to conditions that are present from birth, and can be inherited or caused by genetic factors, environmental exposures, or other causes.

It's important to note that while Cataract 36 has a specific definition and is known to have a material basis in homozygous mutation in the TDRD7 gene on chromosome 9q22.33, it may also be referred to by other terms such as CATC4 or CTRCT36. These alternative names may be used in different contexts, but ultimately all of these terms refer to the same condition - a cataract that is caused by autosomal recessive inheritance and has a material basis in mutation of the TDRD7 gene.",7,True

It is one of several types of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, which refers to a group of genetic disorders that primarily affect the muscles of the shoulders, arms, legs, and hips.
AR-LGMD is caused by mutations in one of several genes located on the autosomal chromosome (chromosomes 3, 6, 9 or 12). These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are essential for muscle function. When these proteins are missing or do not work properly, it can lead to weakness and wasting of the muscles over time.
Symptoms of AR-LGMD can vary widely depending on which specific gene is affected and which muscle groups are involved. Common symptoms may include weakness in the hip, thigh, or shoulder muscles; difficulty walking; and foot deformities such as pes planus (flatfoot). Some people with AR-LGMD may also experience heart problems or other health issues related to the muscles.
There is no cure for AR-LGMD, but treatments are available to help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. These may include physical therapy, medications, orthotics (such as braces), and assistive devices like wheelchairs or walkers. It's important to work with a healthcare provider to develop an individualized treatment plan that addresses your specific needs and goals.",4,True

","Autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2q is a genetic disorder that affects the muscles in the arms, legs, shoulders, and hips. It is caused by a mutation in the PLEC1 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called plectin. This protein plays an important role in maintaining the structure of muscle fibers, and when it isn't working properly, it can lead to weakness and muscle breakdown.

Autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2q is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the condition. It can affect people of all ages, but it often becomes more noticeable during adolescence or adulthood.

There is no cure for autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2q, but treatment may include physical therapy, medications to manage symptoms, and supportive care.",5,True

","Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 3, also known as CMH3, is a form of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). HCM is a genetic heart condition characterized by the thickening and stiffening of the heart muscle. It can lead to reduced blood flow out of the heart, making it harder for the heart to pump blood effectively.

HCM can be caused by mutations in any one of several genes, including those that encode proteins involved in sarcomere function (such as TPM1 and DHPS), or those that regulate calcium ion movement (such as CAV3). In the case of HCM3, specifically, it is caused by a heterozygous mutation in the alpha-tropomyosin gene (TPM1) on chromosome 15q22.

There are different types of HCM, based on which genes have been affected and which proteins are involved. In addition to HCM3, some common examples include HCM1 (caused by mutations in the DHPS gene), HCM2 (caused by mutations in the beta-myosin heavy chain gene), and HCM4 (caused by mutations in the sarcosin gene).

It's important to note that not everyone with a diagnosis of HCM will experience the same symptoms or require the same treatment. Some people may have mild symptoms that can be managed with lifestyle changes, such as exercise and dietary restrictions, while others may have more severe symptoms that require medication or even surgery.

","Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 4, also known as CMH4 or familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy type 4, is a subtype of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy characterized by mutations in the MYBPC3 gene on chromosome 11p11. It is one of several types of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which are inherited forms of the disease that can cause thickening and stiffening of the heart muscle. In addition to myocytes in the left ventricle, mutations in MYBPC3 have also been found in atria and other non-myocyte cells within the heart. Other types of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be caused by mutations in various genes, such as TTN, DSG2, or Lamin A/C. It is important for individuals with a family history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to seek genetic counseling and testing to determine their risk and potential for the development of this inherited condition.",4,True

    :has_definition ""An osteogenesis imperfecta found in a single South African family."" .

","Osteogenesis imperfecta with opalescent teeth, blue sclerae and wormian bones but without fractures is a genetic disorder characterized by the production of weak collagen. This results in fragile bones that are prone to breaking easily. The condition is typically diagnosed in early childhood and can cause multiple fractures throughout a person's life.

The term ""opalescent"" refers to the pale or translucent appearance of the teeth due to the weakened collagen. Blue sclerae are the colored part of the eye that surrounds the pupil, and wormian bones are small bumps on the skull. In this particular form of osteogenesis imperfecta, the presence of these features suggests a mild form of the disorder.

It is important to note that osteogenesis imperfecta can be inherited or occur sporadically (without a known family history). The condition can affect people of all races and genders, although it is more common in certain populations. Treatment for osteogenesis imperfecta typically involves medications to improve bone density and strength, as well as orthopedic devices such as braces or casts to prevent fractures. In severe cases, surgery may also be necessary.",2,True

It is one of the three main types of osteogenesis imperfecta, which is a group of genetic disorders that affect the normal development of bones. OI4 is an autosomal dominant condition, meaning that it can be passed down through families and can affect people regardless of their gender.

OI4 occurs when there are mutations in either the COL1A1 gene on chromosome 17q21.33 or the COL1A2 gene on chromosome 7q21.3. These genes provide instructions for making a protein called collagen type I, which is essential for the development and maintenance of strong bones. When these genes are mutated, it can result in an insufficient amount of functional collagen or an abnormal structure of the collagen, leading to weakened bones that break easily.

Individuals with OI4 may experience a variety of symptoms, including bowed legs, dentinogenesis imperfecta, and hearing loss. They may also have normal sclerae, which are the white part of the eye. Treatment options for OI4 include medications to improve bone density, physical therapy to strengthen muscles around the affected bones, and in some cases, surgery.

","Retinitis pigmentosa 4 (RP4) is a type of retinal degeneration that belongs to the group of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) diseases. RP is an inherited condition that affects the retina, the part of the eye responsible for vision. It causes progressive loss of vision due to the death of photoreceptors, especially rods, which are essential for scotopic vision in dim light conditions.

RP4 is caused by mutations in the RHO gene located on chromosome 3q22. The RHO gene encodes a protein that plays an important role in the formation and maintenance of cilia, which are microscopic structures found in various organs and tissues. Cilia help with movement, sensation, and other functions in the body.

The exact cause of RP4 is unknown; however, researchers suggest that mutations in the RHO gene might lead to abnormalities in cilia functioning, which could contribute to the development of retinal degeneration.

Diagnosing RP4 can be challenging since its symptoms are similar to other forms of RP. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective management and treatment options. Genetic testing or examining the affected family members' genetics may help identify the presence of a mutated gene responsible for the disease.

There is no specific cure for RP4, but several treatments are available to slow down its progression, such as:
- Gene therapy to replace faulty genes with functional ones
- Vitamin supplements like AREDS 2 formula (antioxidants to protect the eye)
- Low vision aids and devices for improved vision
- Cystoid macular odema (CMO) management, which involves laser treatment or anti-VEGF injections

It is essential to consult an eye care professional if you suspect you have RP4 or are at risk of inheriting the condition. They can provide appropriate guidance and support based on your specific case and needs.",7,True
