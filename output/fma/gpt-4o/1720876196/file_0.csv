right atrium synonym a Right atrium of heart.","The right atrium is a right cardiac chamber continuous with the superior and inferior vena cava. It is a type of cardiac atrium and is located anteroinferior to the right ventricle and superior vena cava, and anterosuperior to the inferior vena cava. The right atrium receives its arterial supply from various branches of the right coronary artery, including the crista terminalis branch of the sinoatrial nodal artery, the lateral atrial branch, the left posterior atrial branch, the posterior atrial branch, the recurrent atrioventricular branch, the sinoatrial nodal branch, the anterior atrial branch, the atrial branch, and the intermediate atrial branch.

The right atrium consists of several attributed parts, including the cavity of the right atrium, the right atrium proper, the right auricle, the wall of the right atrium, the inflow part, and the outflow part. It is bounded by the surface of the right atrium and contains constitutional parts such as the fibrous ring of the tricuspid valve, the lymphatic capillary bed, the neural network, the systemic capillary bed, the tricuspid valve, the wall of the right atrium, the atrioventricular septum, and the interatrial septum.

The right atrium is continuous distally with the inferior vena cava, the coronary sinus, the right ventricle, the small cardiac vein, the superior vena cava, and the anterior cardiac vein. It is located to the left of the left atrium, the right lung, and the right ventricle. It drains lymph to the right bronchomediastinal lymphatic tree and receives nerve supply from the deep cardiac nerve plexus. The right atrium is oriented posterosuperior to the fibrous ring of the tricuspid valve and the apex of the heart, and it is posterior to the left atrium and posterosuperior to the right ventricle. It is a regional part of both the biatrial part and the right side of the heart, and it has venous drainage through the small cardiac vein.

The right atrium is different from the left atrium but shares some common features such as being a cardiac atrium and continuous with the inferior vena cava and the right ventricle, and being a regional part of the right side of the heart. The right atrium has several non-English equivalents, including Atrio derecho, Atrium cordis dextrum, Atrium dextrum, Atrium droit, and Rechter Atrium. The preferred name is ""Right atrium"" and it is also known as the ""Right atrium of the heart.""",gpt-4o,62,65,16,343,82,1,1,72,62,52,10.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,9.0,22.0,22.0,

left atrium synonym a Left atrium of heart.","The left atrium is a left cardiac chamber that is continuous with the pulmonary venous trunk. It is a type of cardiac atrium and is located at least anterior to the right atrium, anteroinferior to the left ventricle and the trunk of the left superior pulmonary vein, and anterosuperior to the trunk of the left inferior pulmonary vein. The left atrium receives arterial supply from various branches, including the circumflex branch of the left coronary artery, the crista terminalis branch of the sinoatrial nodal artery, the left posterior atrial branch of the right coronary artery, the posterior atrial branch of the right coronary artery, the recurrent atrioventricular branch of the right coronary artery, the sinoatrial nodal branch of the right coronary artery, the atrial branch of the circumflex coronary artery, and the atrial branch of the right coronary artery.

The left atrium comprises several attributed parts: the left atrium proper, the left auricle, the inflow part of the left atrium, and the outflow part of the left atrium. It is bounded by the surface of the left atrium and includes constitutional parts like the cavity of the left atrium, the fibrous ring of the mitral valve, the lymphatic capillary bed of the left atrium, the mitral valve, the neural network of the left atrium, the systemic capillary bed of the left atrium, the wall of the left atrium, and the interatrial septum.

Continuity exists between the left atrium and various structures such as the left inferior pulmonary vein, the left superior pulmonary vein, the left ventricle, the right inferior pulmonary vein, the right superior pulmonary vein, the superior pulmonary venous tree, the trunks of the left and right inferior and superior pulmonary veins, the inferior pulmonary venous tree, and the interatrial septum.

The left atrium is positioned directly right of the left lung, left ventricle, and right atrium. It undergoes lymphatic drainage through the left bronchomediastinal lymphatic trunk. It is medial to the left lung and oriented in coordination with the posterosuperior plane of the fibrous ring of the mitral valve and the apex of the heart. The left atrium is posterosuperior to the left ventricle and regionally part of the basal zone of the heart, the biatrial part of the heart, and the left side of the heart. It also includes the inflow and outflow parts of the left atrium. The left atrium has tributaries from the left and right common pulmonary veins and venous drainage through the great cardiac vein and the oblique vein of the left atrium.

The left atrium is the same as a cardiac atrium and regionally part of the left side of the heart. It has several non-English equivalents such as ""Atrio izquierdo,"" ""Atrium cordis sinistrum,"" ""Atrium gauche,"" ""Atrium sinistrum,"" and ""Linker Atrium."" The preferred name for this structure is the ""Left atrium,"" with a synonym being ""Left atrium of heart.""",gpt-4o,64,71,15,320,77,1,1,69,61,55,8.0,1,1,1.0,,5.0,1.0,7.0,16.0,16.0,

right ventricle synonym a Right ventricle of heart.","The right ventricle, a right cardiac chamber, is continuous with the pulmonary arterial trunk. It is a type of cardiac ventricle and is situated anteroinferior to the pulmonary trunk and the right atrium. The right ventricle receives arterial supply from various branches, including the posterior interventricular branches of both the right and left coronary arteries, the ventricular branch of the right coronary artery, and the anterior interventricular branch of the left coronary artery. Additionally, it has arterial supply from the absent left and right coronary arteries and the anterior branch of the anterior interventricular branch of the left coronary artery.

The right ventricle includes several attributed parts, such as the cavity and wall of the right ventricle, inflow and outflow parts, all partitioned into specific segments. It is bounded by the surface of the right ventricle and constitutionally includes the cavity, fibrous ring of the tricuspid valve, lymphatic capillary bed, neural network, pulmonary valve, systemic capillary bed, tricuspid valve, wall, and interventricular septum.

The right ventricle is continuous with the pulmonary trunk, right atrium, and interventricular septum, located directly to the left of the left ventricle and right lung, and to the right of the pulmonary trunk and right atrium. Its lymphatic drainage is through the right bronchomediastinal lymphatic trunk, and it is medial to the right lung. The nerve supply comes from the deep cardiac nerve plexus and the right coronary nerve plexus.

In terms of orientation, the right ventricle is aligned with the plane of the fibrous ring of the tricuspid valve and the apex of the heart, with coordinates being anteroinferior and anterosuperior, respectively, and both with right laterality. It is positioned posterior to the left ventricle, posterosuperior to the right atrium, and is a regional part of the biventricular part of the heart, mid zone, and right side of the heart. It also includes inflow and outflow parts and is superior to the diaphragm. Venous drainage is through the great and small cardiac veins.

The right ventricle is distinct from the left ventricle and can be described as a cardiac ventricle and a regional part of the right side of the heart. Non-English equivalents include ""Rechter Ventrikel,"" ""Ventricule droit,"" ""Ventriculus cordis dexter,"" ""Ventriculus dexter,"" and ""Ventrículo derecho."" Its preferred name is ""Right ventricle,"" and it is also known synonymously as the ""Right ventricle of heart.""",gpt-4o,57,62,16,289,69,1,1,61,53,47,8.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,7.0,16.0,16.0,

left ventricle synonym a Left ventricle of heart.","The left ventricle is the left cardiac chamber that is continuous with the aorta. It is a type of cardiac ventricle and is located anteroinferior to the left atrium and the ascending aorta, and anterosuperior to the right ventricle. It receives arterial supply from various branches of the coronary arteries, including the circumflex branch, diagonal branch of the anterior descending branch, left anterior branch of the anterior interventricular branch, left marginal artery, posterior interventricular branch, and others. Additionally, the left ventricle contains several constitutional parts, such as the cavity, fibrous ring of the mitral valve, lymphatic capillary bed, mitral valve, neural network, systemic capillary bed, wall, aortic valve, atrioventricular septum, and interventricular septum. It is continuous with the left atrium, ascending aorta, and interventricular septum, and is positioned directly left of the ascending aorta, directly right of the left atrium, left lung, and right ventricle. The left ventricle has lymphatic drainage to the left bronchomediastinal lymphatic trunk and is medially located to the left lung. It receives nerve supply from the deep and superficial cardiac nerve plexuses and is oriented in relation to the plane of the fibrous ring of the tricuspid valve and the apex of the heart. The left ventricle is also superior to the diaphragm and part of the biventricular region and the left side of the heart. It has venous drainage through the cardiac vein and coronary sinus. In other languages, it is known as Linker Ventrikel, Ventricule gauche, Ventriculus cordis sinister, Ventriculus sinister, and Ventrículo izquierdo. The preferred name is ""Left ventricle,"" and it is also synonymously referred to as the ""Left ventricle of heart.""",gpt-4o,59,66,15,252,60,1,1,56,52,50,4.0,1,1,1.0,,5.0,1.0,3.0,8.0,8.0,
