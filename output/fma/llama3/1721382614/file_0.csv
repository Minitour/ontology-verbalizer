left ventricle synonym a Left ventricle of heart.","Here's a casual paragraph summarizing the information:

The left ventricle is one of the four chambers in the heart, responsible for pumping blood to the rest of the body. It receives oxygenated blood from the left atrium and pumps it out through the aorta, which supplies the entire body with oxygen and nutrients. The left ventricle also receives blood from the anterior, posterior, and circumflex branches of the coronary arteries, as well as the marginal artery. Its surface is bounded by the surface of the heart, and its cavity is continuous with the aortic valve. The left ventricle is supplied by nerves from the deep cardiac plexus and drains into the coronary sinus. It's also connected to other parts of the heart, such as the interventricular septum and the apex of the heart.",llama3,59,66,15,252,60,1,50,56,52,1,1,1,1.0,3.0,8.0,8.0,4.0,1.0,5.0
