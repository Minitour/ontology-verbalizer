Ellis-van Creveld syndrome (EVC) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a combination of physical features, including short stature, extra fingers or toes, and congenital heart defects. It's also known as Chondroectodermal dysplasia, and it's classified under various medical categories such as autosomal recessive disease, cardiogenetic disease, ectodermal dysplasia syndrome, and Jeune syndrome. The condition has been linked to several databases and registries, including the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD), and the Orphanet database. According to the definition provided, EVC is a skeletal and ectodermal dysplasia that affects multiple systems of the body.",llama3,13,22,12,46,1,4,1,12,8,1,7,1,1,8,1.0,1.0
